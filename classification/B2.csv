1;2794;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules
3;2849;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The numbers where so close it isn't fair to that participants time to not get a bonus
1;2532;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions said that the person with fewer correct answers would get nothing and the person with the most correct answers would get .15 per correct answer. Changing the bonus would not be right or moral.
3;568;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although Participant Y solved 16 problems and Participant X solved 12 problems, I feel both should be compensated. Participant X should get something for solving the problems although they did not complete as many.
2;209;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  since they both took their time to solve the tasks they both deserve to receive a bonus, i allocated 2 dollars to participant Y because he solved more and the rest $1.15 goes tp participant X
9;3374;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It appears to me that X did better in their grouping than Y did in their's. Thus, a sharing of the wealth is appropriate.
1;2120;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I had no reason to take what they earned.
2;1363;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to allocate some of the earnings of participant Y to participant X since he solved fewer problems, and it would be fair to redistribute some in this instance.
3;1481;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Xdid answer 11 questions. Even though Yanswered 4 more wuestions-I feel X should be given something for trying to answer as many as she could.
3;1497;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like participant X lost by 6 to participant Y. Because of their results being close, I feel like participant X should b rewarded something for solving some right.
2;1252;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  maybe I failed to understand you fully but if one is getting 15 cents for each questin answered correctly, then participant x deserved to get sth agter answering 20 correct questions. Thats why I sacrificed 1 dollar.,
3;731;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one participant guessed slightly less correct, so I felt like they deserved some money, but not fully half.
9;2999;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to be a good person and share
2;1882;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participan y deserved the full payment
2;3121;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe they should receive something for participating.
3;1219;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because he solved 1 less than participant Y hence equal distribution seemed a bit fair
2;1335;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did better and should therefore benefit more than X
6;1133;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It promotes fairness.
1;372;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were to only compensate whoever answered more questions than the other.
2;1230;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main motivation is to acknowledge the efforts made by the other participant. It feels like a fair decision.
3;1676;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it was only a difference of a few, so I think each deserves something
2;2679;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the participant who got nothing should at least get a little bonus for solving some of the problems.
1;690;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not choose to redistribute any of participant Y's earnings based on very clear rules from the beginning-the participants would only be paid if they performed as well as if not better than their partner. Both participants agreed to those terms, and Y earned the money correctly by doing better than X. To alter the outcome now would cast an undeserving shadow of doubt on the fairness and transparency of the agreement that had been initially reached.
2;2787;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like Participant X should get something for their effort as they answered some questions correctly. However, Participant Y should get the larger reward since their performance was better.
3;3247;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that there should be an equitable distribution of the earnings. I felt that was the fair thing to do since they both performed almost the same.
2;137;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it was the effort of y to earn his money
6;2651;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because I believe if you have the chance to be fair then do it!!
2;789;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's only fair to get the share since he participated.
3;2346;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 2 problems, while Participant Y solved 7, which is a substantial difference. Participant X did not meet the threshold to earn anything according to the original rules.
3;3346;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reward should be more or less proportional to the number of questions answered correctly.
2;1139;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x took part in the work so compensating them would be good
6;2687;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe its equal and fair
1;1004;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The answer is 0 because the rules said only the person who solved at least as many problems as the other would earn money. Since Y solved more than X, Y earned the money fairly. Changing that would go against the rules both agreed to.
4;1223;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to make them have equal amount
2;700;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X showed good results and should receive a small bonus
1;2285;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were known up front, they should be followed.
1;530;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y should keep their full $2.70, and participant X should receive $0.00, as per the original terms of the task. This preserves the integrity of the incentive system and rewards performance as agreed.
9;2364;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved at least as many problems as Participant Y. It doesnt seem fair at all for them to have even done some work and received nothing.
9;166;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  want to give them at least a little
3;3178;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X answered 4 questions and should be compensated accordingly regardless of the disparity between X & Y
2;1956;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because Y perform better and should be rewarded better than X.
2;3294;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They still got some questions right and the first person wont miss the 59 cents
2;2595;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would like to be completely fair and give the other participant a deserving amount.
2;2590;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though participant x got less than participant y, they still did do something, so I think they should get some compensation.
4;2899;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x should also be given a certain share of the amount. The amount I have choosen is to try and equalise both of them.
8;1278;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Redistributing it would give the loser the impression that this sort of thing would happen again.  They might rely on it happening again in the future, or even feel entitled to it.  Also, redistributing it would have demotivated the winner so they wouldn't have tried as hard in the future and would have looked for other people to do well around.
1;362;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It may feel fair to share the earnings for effort, but this would go against the agreed competitive incentive structure if something was given
2;3318;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the amounts were not distributed then the other person would have got nothing for his time and effort
3;2316;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y clearly deserved more for solving more, but Person X did pretty well.  I did not want to penalize Y for the sake of X so tried to be fair and go with what I would have felt comfortable doing myself.
9;1539;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was random
1;2126;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The study described how the outcome would be applied.
2;1652;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I think its unfair/unkind to ask someone to do something like solve problems and then not pay them for it when that is the entire reason we are all here.
2;1227;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the other participant deserves a little something for their work, even though they didn't outperform. I didn't want to take away too much from the winner's earnings as this goes against what they were told about payments.
9;2464;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that that is a good amount to give as it seems average and not too small and not too large
2;3355;"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant earned the money; therefore should get all the money."
10;1228;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  So far as they are partners the reward should be shared, if one is not selfless enough he can just give any amount he wants to give.
1;148;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  based on the rules, person Y should get all of the money for solving significantly more problems than person X.  Person Y should not be penalized just to make things appear more 'fair' toward person X.
2;2932;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y worked so very much harder, and I did not feel that they should have any funds removed.  Had the payment been larger I may have decided to take a bit for X, but the payment was not large.
3;2098;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fair for them to earn one-third of the distribution considering they answered only 3 questions less correctly, 70% compared to the winner.
9;1896;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Redistributing  and sharing
2;666;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Given that they all made efforts to solve the problem and that, I believe each should be paid based on the efforts made
9;2259;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that figure will be enough
2;3357;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Seems fair, as long as the effort was put in.
2;2633;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though X was not able to solve he should be compensated for at least attempting it.
2;2132;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that participation in a work activity should be paid at least a small amount and thought the 2 participants were advised in advance that an adjustment might take place so some adjustment is fair
1;782;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute earnings because Participant Y performed significantly better than Participant X and earned their reward according to the rules both agreed to beforehand. Redistributing would undermine the fairness of a system based on relative performance and would penalize Y despite their superior results. Upholding the original rules maintains consistency and respects the integrity of the task.
3;1947;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems unfair for one to get nothing when they both were correct about the same number of times.
2;2985;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The all-or-nothing reward system seemed excessive, but the better performer should receive a bonus for their performance.
2;3358;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both parties contributed effort to the project, both should be rewarded.
9;2149;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think people should receive what they earn
1;384;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The motivation for the distribution decision was anchored on the agreed standard rules beforehand with participant Y earning the reward as a greed. As such, taking from participants would undermine the game expectations and fairness.
1;2939;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The original rules that both parties agreed to have not changed.  B should not be penalized because of an arbitrary decisionmaker.
1;216;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't like the idea of wealth redistribution, even in tiny amounts like this.
2;2238;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X got some problems correct as well, just fewer than Y. there shouldn't be all-or-nothing rewards.
3;1049;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X was 2 problems short on what Participant Y solve which involved some effort. Fraction earning goes to acknowledge that effort.
6;3030;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  As close to 50% should be fair.
2;2613;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  person y won easily and deserves the money
6;624;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be fair to each participant
9;2513;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that distributing money like that isn't equitable and doesn't result in positive consequences.
2;1853;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am assuming that Participant X put time and effort into answering the questions also. It j7st seemed fair.
2;3140;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were due 1/3 of the total winnings due to their response rate, nothing else.
9;1613;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because Y only earn 0.07 and it would not increase x that much
1;3098;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I followed your established rules.
2;815;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Looking at the distribution it is clear to me that player x worked hard and put in effort. I don't think it is fair that reward is only tied to success. While a higher reward being given to Y for being more successful is fine, I think as long as both players made an effort there should be some reward, that feels more fair to me. Therefore I have X $1 because that felt like a more fair allocation to me.
2;3125;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He solved 13 problems. It costs 1 usd
1;3227;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one who earned the money should keep it.
6;823;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Fairness and equal sharing
1;1748;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That is the agreement you made with the two participants, so I am going to honor it.
8;772;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It will be best to make the candidate have a feel of some rewards to make the candidate try harder
1;1553;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I mostly based it out of the rules that each participant agreed upon before they started the task. It would be very unfair to reward participant X with anything.
9;2173;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It stated it would pay .15 per answer, thus .15 X 4
3;2868;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant correctly did 7 more puzzles than the other one. But, the one that did 10 also did a good job of getting that many correct. I think they deserve something for their effort.
3;591;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did almost as well and deserved some compensation, but not as much as Y.
5;2850;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told that there would be a final round that may affect their distributions. I allocated a nominal amount to the losing participant.
3;1877;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant A solved about half the problems of B so they should get at least a small reward.
3;2465;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants scores were reasonably close, but Y still solved a few more problems. I thought my distribution of the total earned was fair given the number of problems each person solved.
2;2322;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they participated well, but not as good at the other participant
3;3013;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was a semi even distribution between the two people
2;525;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that they should still be compensated for participating. They can get the extra cents made.
1;2637;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were explained ahead of time. If someone didn't think they'd be strong, they shouldn't invest the time. (But politically, I want some redistribution from high earners! This case was low stakes, so I figured my morals were still ok.)
