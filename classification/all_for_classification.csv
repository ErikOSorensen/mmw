1,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  
3,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the efforts of 12 vs 17 deserve some compensation
4,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems more fair to me that the participant with less correct answers should be paid for the problems that they solved correctly. which I estimated to be somewhat less than a third.
5,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems fairly distributed as much reward for Y and for X just acknowledging the efforts.
6,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Taking a small portion of Participant Y's earning would still be fair in that situation.
7,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Brief and direct to the point
8,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I applied both fairness in rewarding Y based on the excellent performance (merit) as well as appreciation of the effort exerted by X (fairness), and at the same time trying my best to make the incentives significant. A 20 percent redistribution blunts the all-or-nothing pay off without compromising the advantage of Y."
9,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules did not allow participant x to earn,there fore i could not share"
10,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel it is somewhat unfair that participant x receives nothing, while only having solved one less question than participant y."
11,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To encourage participant's X actions.
12,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give $0.50 to participant X because even though they didnt do as well as Y, they still put in effort and solved some problems. At the same time, I wanted to make sure Y kept most of what they earned since they performed much better. This felt like a fair way to recognize both effort and achievement."
13,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Small performance gap, significant outcome difference."
14,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the reward effort is slightly while fairness and merit based performance
15,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the other participation will pull up and do more as I will
16,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X was selfless and participant Y benefitted from the other participant's selflessness.
17,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since when one takes part in any participation need to be rewarded or appreciated
18,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.90 to Participant X and $2.40 to Participant Y to balance fairness and merit. While Participant Y clearly outperformed X and deserves the larger share, Participant X still performed better than most participants, and receiving nothing despite that effort feels overly harsh. This partial redistribution acknowledges Xs solid performance without undermining the incentive structure of rewarding higher achievement. It reflects a more balanced approach that values both relative success and individual effort."
19,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules were clear and the participants had agreed to it
20,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants were told the rules, and one participant completed more of the puzzles than the other. While I personally don't think that the payment system is fair, both participants agreed to it."
21,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was mainly motivated by the principle of equity and fairness. the diistribution makes each participant's reward close to fair or equal.
22,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was a winner and a loser of the competition.  It was all or nothing.  I didn't redistribute because not everyone in a competition deserves a trophy when there is clearly a winner and a loser.
23,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since there was only one issue separating the two participants' performances, I decided to give Participant X $0.55 more. It appears reasonable to acknowledge Participant X's tremendous effort even though Participant Y should receive a reward for performing marginally better. This division recognizes nearly equal contributions while preserving an incentive for improved performance."
24,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to distribute the amount almost equally because we all deserve it
25,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute because both participants agreed to the rules beforehand, and participant Y fairly earned the payment by solving more problems. Changing this after the fact would be unfair and undermine the purpose of rewarding effort and performance.  I decided not to redistribute because both participants agreed to the rules beforehand, and participant Y fairly earned the payment by solving more problems. Changing this after the fact would be unfair and undermine the purpose of rewarding effort and performance."
26,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y had a better performance but X is given that to appreciate the effort
27,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the money should be spilt evenly between the participants for their work in the survey.
28,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel person Y needs the money more than person X
29,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I redistributed half because participant Y performed better and deserves a larger reward, but participant X also put in effort and should receive some compensation. This balances fairness with rewarding performance."
30,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.60 from participant Y to participant X to strike a balance between fairness and merit-based reward.    While participant Y clearly outperformed participant X and deserves the larger share, I believe that participant X still made a meaningful effort by solving 10 problems. Giving them a portion of the earnings helps reduce the harshness of a zero-reward outcome, which may feel discouraging or demotivating despite their effort. At the same time, participant Y retains the majority of their earnings, preserving the incentive for high performance."
31,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was to motivate the participant
32,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants did a great job. though Y did better but also X shows some character of doing a great job in the task.
33,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.40 to Participant X as a small gesture of support while still honoring the original rules and effort-based incentive. Participant Y clearly outperformed X and deserves the majority of the reward, but giving a modest amount to X acknowledges their participation and recognizes that success can depend on many factors."
34,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i like sharing so i just decided to share a small amount
35,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I ensured fairness. Y followed the set rules and earned the reward
36,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute a portion of Ys earnings to X because while Y performed better, I believe X should still receive some compensation for participating and putting in effort. This small redistribution supports fairness and encouragement without disregarding performance-basedÂ rewards."
37,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned their full payment by outperforming Participant X clearly and fairly.
38,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason that motivated my decision is the redistribution rule.
39,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is because t participant y made more effort than participant X
40,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  always follow the rules when making decsion
41,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y scored more correct answer as compared to participant X
42,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of how the money would be distributed were clearly stated and I'm assuming that Participant X was aware of this, so it's not fair to penalize Participant Y and take away from their earnings when they did nothing wrong."
43,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is because participant Y clearly outperformed X placing well above average while participant X is really significantly below average. For the incentive structure was made clear to both participants before beginning so did both have an equal opportunity. I value fairness and responsibility.
44,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The scores were close, so I think X deserved something at least."
45,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not redistribute the earnings since Participant Y did not break the rules and took the award coming up with more correct answers. Neither of the participants argued with the terms as they were aware that the highest-performing player is going to receive a payment. It would be wrong to adjust the payout later and may demotivate to perform well in subsequent tasks. One should keep the promise and pay off success.
46,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned more and deserves the larger reward  but participant X still put in effort and earning nothing can feel discouraging
47,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I opted not to share any of the earnings of Participant Y as both the participants had agreed to the rules in advance of which it was made clear that only the participant who got more right answers would be paid money. Participant Y deserved the reward because he/she performed better. Retrospective adjustment of the allocation would destabilize the compensation system and the merit system of rewards.
48,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute any earnings because the payment was based on the number of problems solved, and participant X did not meet the threshold. This ensures fairness by adhering to the initial terms of the task."
49,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the main reason that motivated my decision was due to the rule that was given or set. Participant Y solve more problems than Participant X hence earned more money compared to Participant X
50,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.30 (20%) to Participant X to acknowledge their effort while still rewarding Participant Ys better performance, striking a balance between fairness and merit. This ensures Y retains most of their earnings but X receives some compensation for their work, softening the harshness of the all-or-nothing payoff structure."
51,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  At least some fairness.
52,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's only fair to give participant X. a little amount.  Participant Y still has a larger share than X.
53,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y had a greater performance with the same set of rules. Performance based compensation will ensure that the compensation is fair and also upholds to the initial agreement agreed to.
54,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think Participant X also did quite well in resolving the puzzle with 16 questions correctly answered. Therefore, it is only fair that they get something."
55,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both X and Y participated in the task. The correct answers were close enough to believe that both attempted the task with equal effort. This is the basis for my decision.
56,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants agreed to the rules beforehand, which specified that only the higher or equally performing participant would earn money. It would be unfair to change that after the fact."
57,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He/she should not benefit from other's hard work
58,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I found it fair enough to acknowledge the effort of the other partcipant not to let them walk empty handed yet they put so much effort and atleast managed to solve quiet a number of the problems. Deciding to give this partcipant  $1.05 was like a token of apprecition.
59,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  what motivated me is the clearly stated structure of distributing the merits thus redistributing to x would undermine the efforts of y
60,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because he made effort to get some questions correct.
61,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that is the fair choice
62,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also made some decisions that deserve some reward.
64,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because they all participated,and they all need to be compensated"
65,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I understand participants Y real do a great work by solving 20 questions but X also solve 13 questions. They may encounter different scenerio while solving the problem. The best to ensure equality because what happen to X today might happen to Y tommorow.
66,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My primary justification behind the choice of allocating 0.00 of the earnings of participant Y to participant X is that the conditions of the task were unambiguous and reasonable at the beginning. The participants both accepted a game in which earnings were a relative measure: only a problem solver is paid, and only so long as equal or more problems are solved than the paired partner. participant Y solved more problems (19 vs. 17) than participant X, hence, received the award. Distribution of the earnings of Y will ruin the initial agreement on what is supposed to work on the task, and will undermine the rationality and honesty of the incentive system. It would be also an injustice to punish the person who obeyed the regulations and won. When incentive systems are used, they are most effective when they provide an incentive to the effort and performance done in agreement. Manipulating the results post fabrication will undermine the trust in such systems in coming research."
67,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give 0.5 of Ys earnings to X because the chart showed that X performed reasonably well and deserved some compensation for their effort. While Y still performed better overall, I felt a partial redistribution was fair to acknowledge Xs contribution without fully taking away the reward Y earned through higher performance."
68,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems to me that some compensation should be awarded to all participants for their time and effort.
69,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to balance them out and make sure X got something as well
70,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To be fair, participant Y performed more problems and followed the rules, so they have to be given the full amount."
71,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because i think this is a fair amount to divide up because they did not have anything at all and the other one had all the rewards
72,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I reallocated some of the earnings of the participant Y as an appreciation of the effort put in by the participant X even though he solved fewer problems. This makes it fair yet the performance-voice incentive system is still in place as Participant Y continues getting higher reward in case his performance is higher.
73,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants solved nearly the same amount
74,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be fair in my decision, although participant Y solved more problems than X  but participants X also put in effort and tried his best. I decided to reward each participant based on their performance"
75,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y got more correct answers than person X
76,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were known ahead of time and with the limited information I have it seems like one participant put in more work than the other.
77,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should share equally in the final results.
78,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants participated so he both should get a bonus.
79,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was motivated by the fact that both people tried and should therefore get something. Person Y should get a little bet higher amount because he/she was the winner. Therefore $1.55 for Y and $1 for X is good.
80,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because that was the rule of the game. The participant did not answer 13 correctly so they did not gain anything
81,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules said they had to answer at least as many as the other person.
82,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to avoid redistribution since participant Y received his or her compensation honestly according to the agreed on valid rules and therefore to alter the same would be unjust.
84,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was motivated by a sense of fairness
88,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to ensure fairness
89,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The decision to give Participant X $1 was motivated by a sense of fairness and compassion. Despite Participant X solving fewer problems, providing some payment acknowledges their effort and participation."
90,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to redistribute $0.50 (22%) from Y to X balances three key principles: merit, fairness, and practicality. While Y objectively performed better (15 correct answers vs. Xs 13) and deserves the majority of earnings, X still contributed meaningful effort (solving 54% of the problems) and should not walk away empty-handed. A small redistribution acknowledges Xs work without undermining Ys achievement, preserving motivation for future tasks. This mirrors real-world systems like performance bonuseswhere top performers are rewarded, but collective effort is still recognized. The $0.50 transfer ensures Y retains most of their earnings ($1.75) while giving X a fair token of participation, fostering both equity and incentive. No extreme outcome  aligns as well with ethical decision-making in competitive yet collaborative environments."
91,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X redistributed after solving the problems
92,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think had it been counted the other way they would have received some compensation.  .50 won't kill anyone and it'll make the first participant feel better.
93,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Ifelt sorry for partiapant X because of no monet
94,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason behind my decision is because both of them worked hard on it and the scores should not be the main judge of the compensation.
96,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though Participant X solved less problems, it would only be fair that they not walk away with nothing for their hard work.  Paticipant Y on the other hand did do the most work, and deserves the lion's share of the prize.  So I decided to divide it between them, in the order I did."
97,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Particiapant x deserves to be paid also.
98,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the money was earned by one participant it should not be shared by the other participant. They didn't earn the money so why should they be given any of it?
99,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't want to evenly distribute, but I wanted to give some."
100,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  What motivated my decision is that participant Y followed the rules and earned their payment fair and square. It doesn't feel right to give participant X any money since they solved fewer problems.
101,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they all put effort towards completing the task
102,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  since participant X solved one question less of participant Y, he should be rewarded for his effort even if its a less reward to Y"
103,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X solved 4 more problems than Y.  The value of these was 60 cents.  I awarded the other person half of the difference.  I felt they deserved something since they did invest time and do the work, and I thought half of that value was reasonable (30 cents)."
104,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  All participants should be paid according to the number of problem they solve, as long they participate"
105,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didnt give any of Ys earnings to X because the rules were clear  you only earn if you do as well or better than your partner. Y solved more problems, so it feels fair they keep what they earned. Changing that after the fact just wouldnt sit right with me."
106,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told what would happen at the beginning. X knew that if he scored less than his counterpart he would receive nothing. Y knew this as well so it is unfair for him to have his reward diminished if he worked hard for it.
107,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Rule fairness  Both participants agreed to a clear incentive structure: only the higher or equal performer earns money. Changing the outcome afterward would violate that agreement.    Performance-based reward  Participant Y earned more by solving more problems. Rewarding performance encourages effort and fairness.    Transparency and consistency  Upholding the original rules maintains trust in the system and ensures all participants are treated equally based on the same criteria.
108,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Im selfish and don't like to share.
109,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just didn't want participant X to get nothing.
110,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not distribute the earnings since I thought that it could go against the agreement that the participants entered into, whch determined payment based on the performance."
111,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because person x also participated in the game should be given something for appreciation
112,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was only a difference of 2 in what was solved.
113,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the participant solves fewer problems than the other participant
114,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Someone answering 11 questions and someone answering 13 questions, the difference is two questions only, therefore I feel person X geting zero shares of the money is completely unfair. There should be a slight difference in the distribution of the money."
115,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants were informed of the stakes of the task they were faced with to do. One person only 33.3% of the problems, whereas the other solved 83.3% of the problems and should be penalized for such a paltry sum of money by having some taken away from them."
116,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since the other participant solved less problems, the participant who solved more problems shouldn't be penalized for that."
117,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Whereas participant Y scored better than X, X also put some effort. Winner takes all home is not fair to the loosing side especially if they had put in a lot of effort."
118,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 to recognize Participant Xs effort while still rewarding Participant Y for performing better. This approach balances fairness and merit without fully undermining the performance-based rules.
120,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.75 (one-third of Ys earnings) to X because their performances were close (13 vs. 15 puzzles), suggesting the gap could reflect minor variability rather than a significant difference in ability or effort. This partial redistribution acknowledges X"
121,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that X should receive something, as they solved almost as many as Y. Y should receive more, since they solved more and came in first place."
122,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I know what it feels like when one person gets everything and you're left with nothing.
123,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It clearly stated in the rules that if he/she solved less problems than the other person, they would get nothing. So it would be unfair to Y to redistribute some of his earnings."
124,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give participant X 0.0 because the payment structure was clearly defined at the beginning of the decision-making.
125,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to ensure every participant is awarded
126,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While Y scored higher ,The outcome was as result of motivation from x and want to recognize the the contribution of both parties"
127,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it would be unfair for participant X not to earn anything while he still did some tasks
128,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I read the instructions provided to the participants. The one participant didn't work as hard as the other so they didn't earn the bonus.
129,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The outcome respects the fairness of the original agreement and rewards performance as defined by the rules.
130,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more problems (16 vs. 10) and thus met the criteria for earning payment, while Participant X did not. The rules of the task clearly stated that payment depends on solving at least as many problems as the other participant, which X did not achieve. Redistributing Ys earnings to X would undermine the incentive structure designed to reward effort and performance. Therefore, I chose not to redistribute any amount to maintain fairness based on the pre-established rules."
131,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i would love to share
132,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant solved 17 questions and deserved a share of the pot on account of their hard work.
133,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I rewarded effort while honoring performance by giving X a small share. Y earned more, but fairness includes recognizing participation and minimizing extreme inequality."
134,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It would make it so the earnings will get distributed evenly
135,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant X tried and solved 4 problem hence he/she deserves a little bonus for solving the problem because they tried.
136,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be fair.
137,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it was the effort of y to earn his money
138,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fair to split the money evenly, simply because both participants did the problems and both got a good amount right. The one who got 0.0 money should get a least a LITTLE compensation for that"
139,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like they both deserve some sort of bonus and they were told that their bonuses may be changed. So it seems fair.
140,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $1.70 to participant X because I believe effort should be recognized, even if the person did not perform best. This redistribution reduces an extreme payoff gap while still giving participant Y a small reward for outperforming."
141,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules given to the participants is that they had to solve as many puzzles as the other player if they wanted to get paid. One player achieved barely half the other one, and both players had the same participation conditions, so I don't see why I should punish the player who put an effort and completed 15 puzzles with redistributing his earnings."
142,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant who earned the bonus should be able to keep 100% of it, and i have no desire to redistribute it"
143,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y deserves because he has worked harder than X; the benefits of this should not be taken away by those who did not deserve it because they are rewards of merit and our rules that have been agreed upon.
144,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that both participants did quite well on the task, so the earnings should be distributed amongst them, but participant Y should keep more than half since they performed better."
146,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 15 problems.  To be fair to participant X.
147,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.00 from participant Y to participant X.    The main reason is that both participants agreed in advance to a clear, rule-based incentive system: rewards would go to the individual who solved as many or more problems than their counterpart. Participant Y performed better and earned fairly under those rules, while Participant X did not meet the performance threshold.    Redistributing earnings after the fact would undermine the integrity of the rules and the motivation system that was set up to encourage effort and performance. While empathy for X is understandable, fairness in this context means respecting the structure that all participants consented to at the start.    Therefore, no redistribution is warranted."
148,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  based on the rules, person Y should get all of the money for solving significantly more problems than person X.  Person Y should not be penalized just to make things appear more 'fair' toward person X."
149,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To manage and motivate distribution partners, focus on aligning their goals with yours by offering clear incentives and ongoing support. Regular check-ins and open communication build trust and keep everyone on track. Offering training and exclusive resources can also help them succeed and stay motivated."
151,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is fair not to distribute anything because the rules were clear, and earnings were to be based on relative performance, and you solved for more than 15 times times X 10"
152,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that participant X did a good job and deserved something for their efforts.
154,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  What motivated my decision was fairness
155,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is because also participant x made an attempt of 2 so she/he must be atleast be compensated
156,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would issue $1 to enable the participant to get payment for the 12 questions answered, which is fair as it is lower than the other participant who answered more questions."
157,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y found many more solutions (18 vs 11) and, therefore, he deserved the payment according to the agreed rules. I did not redistribute juiciness because the work was an output of performance and the payment system was characterized transparently at the beginning. The system of rewarding Y there compliments the effort and justice of contribution in full"
158,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to allocate a part of the income of Participant Y to Participant X to appreciate effort and reward it with merit, bring some earnings to X, who also has contributed to the work. This presents a middle ground between fairness and the early incentive structure without ludicrous results to any of the players."
159,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant's knwq going into the task that there was a possibility they would receive $0.00 as a bonus. They were also promised a certain amount for each correct answer, so I don't feel right reneging on that promise."
160,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants entered into a contest willing. The winner deserves the money
161,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think since person X also solved many questions. It would only be fair since they also put in the work.
162,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were very clear.  I felt it was more important to guarantee the reward for the winning participant than to redistribute it -- which would change the game after it was completed.
163,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to encourage participant X to feel motivated
164,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both exhibited good effort
165,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think Y can share some of their earnings with X, since it seems there were efforts on both their parts."
166,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  want to give them at least a little
167,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.40 to acknowledge Participant Y's stronger performance while also offering modest recognition of Participant X's effort in a challenging task.
168,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To give him at least something.
169,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told that the better performer would get the bonus. I just maintained that premise.
170,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that person X did enough in comparison to warrant some comparison, and person Y is still getting twice as much"
171,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to reward participant x for the correct answers that was completed
172,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Allocation of 7.4% is made based on a specific data point (16 0.074) on the scale, which shall be considered as a fair reward to the input of Participant X (e.g. puzzles solved). The y-axis readings imply proportional results, and 0.074 will be a rational share. There is no further context which goes against such interpretation."
173,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y solved significantly more problems, earning their pay under established rules redistributing the earnings would undermine the original agreement,"
174,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i thought it fairer if the reward was split.
175,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to award the participants with 0.50 knowing that participant X took effort even though he/she did not perform better than Y. This minor redistribution facilitates equality, without completely neglecting performance-based payments."
176,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should be compensated for trying.
177,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it was fair to give the other person at least some bonus because they solved only 1 less problem correctly.
178,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to not redistribute earnings is based on two main principles: adherence to the original rules and maintaining the incentive structure.    Participants were clearly informed that earnings depended on outperforming their partner. Participant Y did so, earning their money according to the established rules. Redistributing funds would undermine the initial agreement and disincentivize effort in future similar tasks."
180,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should both be paid fairly relative to the amount of problems they solved. Since they both solved quite a few problems, I think they both deserve something, which is why I chose to redistribute."
182,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should at least get a small portion of the earnings for the effort of trying to get as many problems correct as participant Y.
183,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants were close in terms of performance. I thought giving about a third of what was earned to the loser seemed a fair consolation prize.
184,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X only solved one problem wrong compared participant Y, it would therefore be unfair to pay X $to 0.0 due to one wrong compared Y. Even though the rules were very clear, we cannot expect two different participants to tie always tie so that they both get paid."
185,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured since participant X was very close to participant Y that I wanted to be fair and just split the bonus near half with participant Y still getting the larger amount since they did do better. I thought about keeping it at 0 shared as well, but in my mind I just wanted to be equal here."
187,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give small rewards to participant X because he solved almost half of the problems
188,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did a better job, and, as per the rules agreed upon, understood that there was a possibility that they would walk away with nothing."
189,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  All participants knew the payouts before participating, so the rules should not be changed."
190,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to recognize the clear performance difference while still acknowledging that both participants put in time and effort. Giving a small portion to X helps soften the all or nothing outcome without taking too much away from Ys deserved reward.
191,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because fair is fair, X was a participant too and deserved at least something out of it."
192,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is unfair for participant X to get 0.0 USD and he solved 11 problems only 7 problems less that participant Y who was paid 2.7  USD. I have distributed 1UUSD to X because he also deserves some compensation for the 11 challenges he completed.
193,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Performance disparity
194,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants appeared to make a decent number of decisions, so I feel the bonus earnings should be split, sort of proportionally to the number of questions they answered/decided"
195,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x earned their payment faily by meeting the condition of oterperforming their partner, while y did not"
196,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i want to reward the effort the other perticipant made also
197,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both worked, so I feel that both should be paid for their work."
198,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel it is fair for Y to keep what they earned
199,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.60 to Participant X and $3.00 to Participant Y to balance fairness with recognition of performance. Participant Y clearly earned the majority through superior results, and that should be respected. However, a small redistribution acknowledges Participant Xs effort and softens the impact of receiving nothing. This decision maintains merit-based reward while showing a degree of compassion."
200,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that Participant X deserved some compensation for their time, even if they did not solve any of the problems correctly."
201,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  then both people are compensated pretty equal but not exactly because i would rather keep a little extra
202,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like the other participant didn't do very well compared to the other participant so I didn't think that some of their payment should go to the other person
203,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the person who solved fewer problems still deserves some kind of reward for it.
204,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 to Participant X to acknowledge that both individuals participated in the task, even though Y clearly performed better. While I believe rewards should largely reflect effort and performance, I also think its fair to give a small amount to someone who earned nothing, to soften the all-or-nothing outcome. This approach maintains incentive for strong performance while showing basic consideration for the lower performer."
205,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   rule for X, whose 11 solved problems weren't terrible, but who was penalized by an exceptionally strong pairing. While rewarding Y's superior performance, giving X $1.00 acknowledges their effort, reducing the severe impact of random chance."
206,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 to participant X and allow participant Y to keep $1.45 of their original $1.95. This decision is motivated by a balance between rewarding merit and acknowledging effort:    Merit-Based Reward: Participant Y performed significantly better than average, solving 13 puzzles  a strong result that deserves clear recognition and the majority of the earnings.    Acknowledgment of Effort: While participant X's performance (9 puzzles) was below average, it still reflects a meaningful contribution. Providing a small portion of the earnings ensures they are not completely left out, which can help maintain motivation and perceived fairness.    Encouraging Participation: A minimal guaranteed reward, even for below-average performers, can reduce discouragement and promote continued engagement in future tasks."
207,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  . Competition is good for society. We can't win all the time.
208,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fairer to simply follow the original rules laid out without making arbitrary decisions about giving some money back to 1 participant who solved fewer problems.
209,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  since they both took their time to solve the tasks they both deserve to receive a bonus, i allocated 2 dollars to participant Y because he solved more and the rest $1.15 goes tp participant X"
210,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It felt bad that both participants put in effort and one got nothing. 50 cents shouldn't make a significant impact on the outcome for the winning participant.
211,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Successful completion of the task was also subject to consent by both the participants. The redistribution of earnings would compromise the entire system of payoffs as it would not be just to take away the earning agreement of participant Y, who appaled more."
212,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant A actually solved 1/2 of the problems (7) while Participant B solved 15. I think it's fair to give the other participant something. I was actually going to put more...
213,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since one answered more questions than the other I felt one deserved more money. So I thought it would be fair.
214,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to reward the participant for the work they did, but not as much as the participant who did more work."
215,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i gave almost half but a little less since Y did win in the end
216,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't like the idea of wealth redistribution, even in tiny amounts like this."
217,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did exceptionally well, but i cant overlook the fact that participant X solved more than 50% of what Y solved.  To show appreciation to all the participants, it is good if they are given the token equals to their percentage correct attempt"
218,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe in applying fair tactics no matter the situation, and I think this amount is more than fair to give out to this participant."
219,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participants proceeded with the task knowing there was a risk of not earning anything. Due to this, I see no reason the change the rules now that the task is completed."
220,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both of them did averagely good, they were at a close proximity so its only fair that the other participant get something and my distribution is very fair because participant Y still got to keep most of the money."
222,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is very unfair that one person has everything while the other gets zero.
223,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seemed based on everyone should receive something
224,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the participant that received the distribution should receive something for the amount of correct answers they had.
225,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Rewarding participant X for the attempt. different participants have varying capabilities so it is fair to not penalize one participant because they performed less than others.
226,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I preferred fairness and effort for the other participant.
227,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I considered participant X's effort hence giving the 1 dollar
228,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give the participant half of what they would've earned. That way the other participant is still earning most of what they would've earned had the earnings not been redistributed, but the lower earning participant doesn't earn nothing at all."
229,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I redistributed to compensate participant X for their effort since they earned nothing despite participating. I aimed for a fair balance, rewarding both participants without severely penalizing the higher performer."
230,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also needed some reward for the participation in an effort to promote equality.
231,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision is very simple, participant Y earned the by getting the most answers correct and should rightfully keep their earnings."
232,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they bet on doing better than another participant and they lost the bet
233,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved double the problems that participant X solved. So I figured it was fair to stick with the way they were told the money would be distributed. I gave it all to the participant who solved the most problems.
234,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since both participants achieved similar scores that were 5 points away from each other, each participant is entitled to earnings of a dollar from the other."
235,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants attempted the task and put in effort, so both deserve some compensation"
236,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My reasons were because participant Y put in the work and solved more problems, so they earned the reward. The rules were clear from the start, and it wouldnt feel fair to take away part of Ys earnings when they followed the rules and did well."
237,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fair for person x to also get some amount since he/she also solved some problems
239,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  People should be willing to share in all situations. Although participant X solved less than half of participant Y, I feel they should receive something and I think participant Y would feel okay if they were awarded $2 instead of the full amount."
240,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were very clear on how the rewards would be given. Even the amount I have suggested to give to participant X was just a consolation
241,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that Participant Y contributed more with their work and earned more based on their merit. It did not feel fair to take this away from them.
242,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  why would i change x participants earnings when the earnings are merit based and y surpassed x?
243,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who earned the money earned it fairly, as they completed more questions than the other participant."
244,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I viewed it as a competition, and the best participant won and they deserve to win the bonus. not everyone can win the trophy and we don't have to punish the better participant in order to be fair or equal."
245,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision not to redistribute earnings was motivated by the principle of merit-based compensation. Both participants agreed in advance to the rules: only the person who solves as many or more problems than their peer earns money. Participant Y performed significantly better and earned their payment fairly. Redistributing Ys earnings to X would disregard the agreed-upon structure and weaken incentives for effort and performance.
246,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since they both participated they should both be compensated and since X accomplished about 1/3 of what Y accomplished that should roughly be the split of what was awarded in total .
247,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the original rule was unfair if the participants had scores that were close, and a difference of only 4 is about the upper limit of what I could consider close.  But they both clearly worked hard, and I felt they should share in the rewards."
248,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not believe in redistribution of wealth
249,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They only got 1 less question so I went with about 45% of the earnings
250,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He deserves some payment at least
251,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X knew up front that if they solved fewer problems than the other person then they would get nothing.  I don't want to penalize person Y for doing well.
252,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe the other participant should at least be compensated partially for participating
253,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  there were rule which were to determine the outcome. that means x lost to y.
254,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is important to reward the time spent and the work Participant X used so its fair to compensate them.
255,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants were given equal and fair chances to participate. They knew the rules before starting the game where Y performed better that X. I will be unfair if Y is not given full amount as per the rule.
256,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that person X should at least get a little because they did get 7 correct.
257,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I choosed to give participant X 0.50 and give participant Y 1.45 because I believe in equal fairness in perfomance.
258,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X deserves something. Obviously Y is good at the problems so it was probably even easier for them to do.
259,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y scored above 0.3 while wile x scored 0, so just being considerate by giving x 0.1"
260,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I assumed that Player X answered 8 problems correctly and Player Y answered 23 problems correctly, thus I divided the $3.44 in relation to those outcomes."
261,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the scores
262,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to allocate a small amount to X since they participated in the study, and it would be fair to have them earn a small participation amount."
263,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I have analyzed how the performed in the task and realized that there is no much difference hence both should earn the same amount.
264,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y performed better according to the task rules and therefore earned the reward fairly.
266,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules for the study state that if the participant earns less than the other they will get nothing, so following the rules."
267,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant  Y earned more by solving more problems. No redistribution rewards effort and ability.
268,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the participant who didn't get anything should receive a little compensation since they almost had as many answers correct as the other person
269,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I majorly considered that while Participant Y clearly outperformed X (18 vs. 8 correct answers), both participants invested time and effort in the task.  I tried to balance the redistribution that acknowledges even the lower-performing participant as they also deserve some reward for their participation."
270,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For participation in the long study they should at least receive some sort of reward. Maybe patterns are not just what they can see too well.
271,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should receive something for his efforts but not as much as y
272,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did put in the effort to complete the task, even though they didn't complete the most task and i believe that they should receive a bit of compensation for their effort."
273,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant X solved nearly as many problems as Y, and giving a small portion of the earnings acknowledges their substantial effort"
274,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I followed the original rules Y solved more problems and earned it. Its fair to let them keep what they worked for.
275,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to share any of the Participant Y income with Participant X because there was a transparent and equal rule introduced initially during the experiment between the two participants which was to determine only the participant who was able to solve more or the same number of problems as his or her partner to earn the money. Participant Y fulfilled this requirement and received his/her money; Participant X failed. Modifying the outcome later would negatively affect the integrity of the rules and discourage doing a good job in this kind of tasks. Adherence to the rules already set makes it fair and consistent to everybody involved.
276,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they also put in time and effort and were pretty close to answering the same amount of questions
277,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Its not fair to not pay the other participant simply because they did one less problem than the other.  They deserve something for their work.
278,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  18 and 23 are not far from each other
279,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 from Participant Y to Participant X because it strikes a balance between rewarding performance and recognizing effort. Participant Y clearly outperformed X and deserves the majority of the earnings, but X still put in meaningful work by solving 10 problems. A small redistribution acknowledges that effort without significantly undermining the merit-based structure or disincentivizing achievement. It reflects both fairness and compassion."
280,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They only had 1 less question right so I thought they should receive something for their effort.
281,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also did the work although he or she solved fewer problems compared to Y.
282,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just want everyone to be fair and it honors the agreement
283,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe it would have been fairer to share a portion of the money to participant X because their score wasn't that bad compared to what participant Y obtained.
285,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute because the rules were clear and participant Y earned the reward by performing better.
286,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the participant deserve an award for the time he devoted himself to this survey
287,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In a sharing gesture and being both were involved half seem to be the right thing to do.
288,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Performance-Based Fairness
289,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  person x attempted to answer the question a bit well too
290,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i felt generous
291,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think it would be fair for participant Y to not earn anything. They still completed tasks, even if it was at a slower rate."
292,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My main reasons that motivated my decisions are that I wanted to give something to X for their effort, it's not like they didn't try at all, as they came very close to Y's score. However, given that Y did win, I did want to ultimately award him a lot more of the earnings for it."
293,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think despite participant X low perfomance, giving him/her 0 is unfair. So I took 1 usd from participant Y and gave it participant X."
294,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because Y earned the money because they put in the extra effort so I would not punish them and give their money to someone who did not earn it.
295,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I know the opponent will do exactly the same when the ball was in his/her hands. No mercy!
296,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They participated and answered few. Just gave them the share of their earning amongst the total of 25 in that they tried and didn't manage to solve more. Was motivated by their effort
297,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  money earned by one individual should not be given to someone who did less
298,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i  believe the distribution should be fair enough since the distribution earnings might go against distibution terms and might be unfair
299,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clear, I do not think participant Y has to give any of his earnings to participant X"
300,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reasons that motivated my decision were fairness, empathy, and the importance of shared responsibility. I considered how the outcome would affect both participants and aimed to make a choice that balanced individual accountability with compassion."
302,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want to keep everything I will earn from this study.
303,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Half of the earnings should be shared as both participants did the work
304,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute because both participants agreed to the rules, participant Y earned more and met the criteria for payment. So its only fair they keep their full earnings."
305,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x deserves to be compensated for the right answers and for participating
306,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just decided each to get a reward since they both done something.
307,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave that amount to Participant X to balance fairness and effort, while still rewarding Participant Ys better performance."
308,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved only 8 problems while Participant Y solved 15. Based on the reward program in this scenario, a participant would be rewarded $0.15 if they solved as many as the other participant per correct response. Participant Y was rewarded $2.25 under this program for matching someone else's count."
309,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clear and known in advance. Y performed significantly better and earned the reward fairly. Redistribution would undermine the incentive structure and fairness of the task.
310,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Putting forth the effort to take the survey and receiving nothing felt very unfair.  X received less than Y, but at least X received something for the time spent on the task."
311,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted participant X to also receive a little amount for his/her contribution to the task.
312,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The difference between participant X and Y's scores is only 3 points thus I don't think one person should get more because the difference is not huge. If the difference was huge, I would have chosen not to distribute."
313,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved fewer problems than participant Y hence he/she should not get anything
314,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Assuming Player X tried their best, they deserve something for their time."
315,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Mine was purely from a neutral point of view.  Y earned fairly by outperforming x
316,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   rule was too harsh for such a minimal performance gap. Participant X's effort and skill in solving 21 problems out of 24 were substantial and deserved recognition beyond zero. By transferring $1.60 from Y to X, my goal was to acknowledge X's strong performance, mitigate the punitive nature of the rule for a slight discrepancy, and ensure both participants received some compensation for their considerable work. This resulted in a more equitable outcome where Y still earned more, reflecting their slightly higher score, but X wasn't entirely unrewarded."
317,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The payout rule was given to both participants before they did the task.  And, according to that rule, the payout should not be changed."
318,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not believe in redistribution of wealth or earnings.  Nor do I believe in giving a medal or prize to all children (even the losers) who compete in competitive events
319,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was close between them on how many they solved.  I think they both deserve some money for their participation though Y deserves a bit more since they solved more problems.
320,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The unpaid participant only completed 2 fewer questions than the paid one, doing almost as much work."
321,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they both solved equations person x solving 18 and y 23 it fair to give them earnings for their contribution
322,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that, in fairness, Participant X should have been awarded at least some of the money as compensation, even though they did not answer as many as Participant Y."
323,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  equality is always encouraged
324,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y deserves all their earnings because they performed much better than X.
325,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that participant X should receive something.
326,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be as even as possible regarding payment.
327,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave $1 to X to recognize their effort while still rewarding Y more for better performance. It's a balance between fairness and merit
328,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although the rule was that the one who solved fewer problems would not get anything, it's only fair that the participant gets something because the contest was close as the other participant only solved two problems more. I'd give the $0.4 to the one who got fewer problems right and $2 for the one who got more problems right."
329,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x also participated it is only fair if he is paid something for the time he took to answer the questions
330,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute a small portion of Ys earnings to X because both participants put in effort and performed relatively close to each other. While Y solved more problems and deserves a higher reward, I believe its fair to recognize Xs contribution with a modest amount. This approach balances merit with a sense of fairness and encouragement."
331,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  SEEMS FAIR TO REWARD THE PARTICIPANT THAT DID BETTER WITH MORE, WHILE STILL REWARDING THE OTHER PARTICIPANT FOR THE WORK PERFORMED."
332,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The perimeters of the task were set and X knew they may not receive anything for their answers.  I cannot see why there should be any redistribution of money from Y and there really is no fair way to determine what that would be.
333,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since they were so close to solving the same amount of problems, I feel that person X should get at least some compensation for their work. However, when they agreed to the study, they knew the conditions and that they might not receive payment. Therefore, since person Y answered more questions, I do feel that they should receive significantly more compensation."
334,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they both deserve a little something
335,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participate put in his fair share of effort.
336,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the money fairly by solving more problems under the same conditions. Changing this now could undermine the principle of merit-based earnings.
338,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel participant X deserves to be given a percentage since the only margin difference of problems solved is 1
339,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Disproportionate reward: Under the original rule, X would earn nothing despite performing almost as well as Y. This felt too harsh for such a small difference.    Fairness and equity: A 50/50 split recognizes both participants' contributions and promotes a sense of fairness, especially since both performed around the average range in the distribution."
340,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it was a contest wasn't it? If I win a race to I share my winnings with 2nd place? Does the losing team at the Super Bowl get to borrow the trophy for a few months? Now if it was a team task, and they pooled the tasks completed i'd split it. But thats not my understanding. Take this socialist nonsense somewhere else."
341,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My choice was based on, if I give participant ,he or she might choose to give back and I will earn some real money"
342,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were simple , and i would not like to rob Y of the effort they out"
343,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y answered more questions and won the award as per the regulations. In this respect, redistribution would not be just."
344,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To appreciate the effort of participant X
345,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think there is a wide enough gap between Participant X and Participant Y to deduce that Participant X likely didn't take the task as seriously as Participant Y. Therefore, I don't feel it is warranted to give some of Participants Y's earning to Participant X when they didn't work as hard and likely didn't earn the reward."
346,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the participant who didn't solve any problem correctly should be given a small award for trying.
347,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  takes two to tango
348,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that Y did deserve their bonus money, but I didn't want X to be completely shut out so I gave them 0.25 cents."
349,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to redistribute among them for trying
351,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not think participant X, who answer fewer problems correctly, should benefit from participant Y who answer more correctly. They understood the possible of receiving and not receiving payment."
353,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  everything must be fair
354,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute the bonus money because I think the person who worked the hardest and got the most correct answers should be the one who gets the payment.
355,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He answered fewer questions correctly.
356,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just don't feel that it would be fair to participant Y to have to share their earnings. I feel participant Y earned his or her payment and they should be able to keep it.
358,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave $0.25 to X to recognize their effort while still rewarding Ys stronger performance.
359,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In order to balance rewarding performance with acknowledging effort, I decided to redistribute $1.00 from Participant Y to Participant X. X made a significant contribution by solving 11 problems, but Y performed noticeably better and should keep the majority of the earnings. The partial redistribution recognizes X's work without compromising the task's merit-based framework."
360,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant was below the mean, while Participant Y was deep in the tails of the distribution"
361,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In accordance with the rules, Participant Y earned the reward fairly after solving more problems. Redistribution is not warranted."
362,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It may feel fair to share the earnings for effort, but this would go against the agreed competitive incentive structure if something was given"
363,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They won the competition Im not taking their money
364,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It would be fair
366,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I follewed the initial earning rules which stated if the other participant solved fewer problems than the other participant he/she gets nothing. Since participant X solved 8 problems and Y 14 problems, therefore x solved fewer problems."
367,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were stated directly to the people doing the task. It would not be fair to participant Y to remove some of their earnings against what was told to them at the beginning of the task.
368,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  trying to be fair
369,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like participant X at least did something and only lost by 4. I figured they would get a chunk of the money, but less than the winner"
370,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I made the decision because they almost solved same number of problems.
371,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X solved fewer problems compared to participant Y.
372,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were to only compensate whoever answered more questions than the other.
373,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that a mere $0.25 wouldn't be a terrible loss/gain for the participants and that they both should get something, but not anything excessive due to their poor performance."
374,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y earned their reward fairly.Redistributing undermines merit-based rules and would be unfair given the performance difference.
375,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X got some questions right and as such, they deserve to get some cut."
376,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think of those were the rules initially as to what would be paid out, it doesn't seem appropriate to change them and take money away from someone."
377,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason is that participant X also had 8 answers which is a quarter of what participant Y had.
379,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My choice to redistribute $0.50 stems from weighing a degree of justice or compassion against merit-based rewards
380,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  aas much as participant x had a lower score ths dispartity was only 4 scores hence should be appreciated as well
381,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  if each question costed .088, then 9 questions right warrants .79 cents to make it even and the one who got 13 get the rest"
382,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute any of participant Ys earnings to participant X because Y solved more problems and fairly earned the $2.4. I believe that rewards should reflect individual effort and performance. Since X solved fewer problems, it seems fair that they dont receive the same payment as Y. I wanted to respect the work that Y put in and maintain the principle of merit-based rewards."
384,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The motivation for the distribution decision was anchored on the agreed standard rules beforehand with participant Y earning the reward as a greed. As such, taking from participants would undermine the game expectations and fairness."
385,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want to ensure something goes to the other participant.
386,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant X dserves a little token for participating atleast reward something for the efforts to motivate the participant for trying to solve the problems.
387,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that both parties required to atleast get something for they participated
388,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think someone participating is a good thing and they should be rewarded regardless.
389,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also took time conducting the survey and it's only fair that he's compensated for his time
390,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clear and agreed upon. Y earned their payment through superior performance. Redistributing would undermine the merit-based incentive structure.
391,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.00 because Participant Y clearly outperformed Participant X by a wide margin (12 vs. 4 problems). The rules were known in advance, and Y earned their payment fairly. Redistributing earnings in this case would undermine the merit-based incentive structure of the task."
392,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give 0.50 to participant X to recognize their effort, even though they didnt perform as well as participant Y. X solved a reasonable number of problems, and a small redistribution feels fair without greatly reducing Ys deserved reward. This balances merit with empathy."
393,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y perfomed better
394,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X was told that if they scored lower than Participant Y, their payment would be zero, and that's what happened. I feel no need to change the amount since that's based on the rules they were given."
395,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any earnings because Participant Y fairly earned their reward under the agreed-upon rules, and altering the outcome would undermine merit-based incentives."
396,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Despite participant X's worse performance than participant Y's, I decided to offer them $0.50 to recognize their effort.  However, as an incentive for better performance, I wanted to make sure that participant Y continued to get the majority of their earnings."
397,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I sought fairness, proportionally recognizing Participant X's effort while rewarding Participant Y's superior performance for a more equitable distribution."
398,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did some work, so I think X should receive something for participation,"
399,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though participant X didn't win, he/she still managed to do 10 questions . I believe this accounts for something. And compared to 14, the difference isn't great for it to constitute him/her getting nothing. So I think giving X 0.6 dollars and leaving 1.5 dollars for Y is fair. 0.6 for 10 and 1.5 for 14."
400,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   to take money from them to hand out to the loser in this case.
401,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  fairness over competition
402,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Candidate X had nothing even after completing 10 problems
403,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to strike a balance between fairness and merit. Participant Y clearly performed better and deserves the majority of the reward. However, giving a small portion to participant X recognizes that they still participated and put in effort. This kind of redistribution encourages participation without completely removing the incentive to perform well.    Let me know if you'd like a version that leans more competitive or more generous."
404,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's only fair that the other participant received a bonus for trying
405,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  for the both participants to atleast get almost equal amounts
406,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because I would like to keep the earnings myself.
407,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since X only missed one problem, I think they should at least get a $1. I believe that they would've solved it if they had enough time."
408,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Equality motivated my decision
410,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because participant x also put in effort and solved several problems
411,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think it would be fair to give them anything when there is such a large difference of problems solved. I personally feel like Y earned it and shouldn't lose any reward based off of someone else not performing well.
412,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That person completed 18% of the total tasks, so I gave them 18% of the total compensation."
413,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it would be fair if even if participant x solved a few problems to get a small share of the earning as the effort was witnessed too.
414,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well i took my time to calculate and make sure all answers and decisions are carefully chosen.
415,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules said only the person who solved the same or more problems would get money. Y solved more, so Y should get the money. It would not be fair to take money from Y and give it to X."
416,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Its good to give does who do not have
417,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was tempted to give the one a token payment for good-faith participation, but the main issue is they entered into a contract when they agreed to the terms of the study, and I felt obliged to stick to the letter of the terms."
418,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Those involved also accepted in advance that they would receive their earnings depending on their performance in the tasks. Any sharing of gains would cause a conflict to the justness and motivation of the study.
419,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Fairness was my motivation everyone was able to leave with some money. Even if the other person has less it is better than nothing.
420,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The original distribution seemed fair. Therefore, since Y solved the highest, he takes the money."
421,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't want to take much away from Participant Y because they solved more questions, but I didn't think it was fair for Participant X to receive nothing. So I gave them a small portion."
422,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Distributed faorly
423,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although participant X did less than participant Y, the difference was only 1 meaning participant x made a notable effort and therefore they deserve a share."
424,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  a fair distribution per the outcome effort as a team
425,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Believe player x should get something for trying
426,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave \$0.50 to X because they worked hard and got close to Ys score. Y still did better, so they keep most of the money. This way, both effort and performance are respected."
427,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt participant x deserved a small amount of earnings due to attempting to do their best
428,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In this situation, participant X solved a lesser number of problems than participant Y, which means Y earned more money. The basic premise of the system is that individuals are rewarded according to the number of problems solved in relation to others, so it would not be correct to just change the payout. Since Y performed better, it would be fair to leave the earnings alone without redistributing."
429,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that it would be unfair to give participant X nothing since they also completed some tasks. They should also earn something
430,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My reason is the partcipant atleast took some of their time to partricipate in solving the problems so he/she deserves some payment
431,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 4 problems and you can 15 cents for every correct answer so I multiplied the 4 with the 15 cents
432,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  HE ANSWERED A FEW QUESTION COMPARE TO THE OTHER PARTICIPANT
433,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to award Participant X who got half the points of Participant Y a little prize of 0.75 to show appreciation of the fact that despite getting less points (in my interpretation due to answering fewer problems), they tried to do their best. The participant Y received a much higher mark, which should be rewarded accordingly, but I do think that some degree of distribution is right to reward participation and not be completely punished with obtaining nothing. This is a balance between rewarding achievement and paying some note to effort."
434,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X competed about two-thirds as many problems as Y. Dividing Y's earnings so that X gets about a third feels like an acceptable compromise with the original rules of the exercise.
435,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For the purpose of fairness.
436,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that based on them answering 7, compared to the 12, it would be unfair If they received nothing in compensation. Based on mutual participation a distribution, although not equal, would be warranted."
437,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though Participant Y performed better than Participant X and should have received a larger prize, I felt that Participant X made a significant effort and shouldn't have been left with nothing, so I decided to transfer $2.00. Giving each person a share of the profits shows compassion, recognizes their involvement, and keeps some motivation for good work without being unduly harsh or unfair.              Even though Participant Y performed better than Participant X and should have received a larger prize, I felt that Participant X made a significant effort and shouldn't have been left with nothing, so I decided to transfer $2.00. Giving each person a share of the profits shows compassion, recognizes their involvement, and keeps some motivation for good work without being unduly harsh or unfair."
438,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I understand that participant Y solved more so it seems fair to pay them more but I dont think X should get nothing.
439,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute a portion the earnings because the performance difference was minimal only one question apart.
440,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems fair to award x just for participating.
442,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x was told that they would get nothing if they completed less so I want to stick with what they were told.
443,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clearly stated and according to the study more people performed average than well. I think the person has earned their pay.
444,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since the participant did not answer that much than the other, i just felt that he should at least be compensated for his effort"
445,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  At least the participant attempted 10 questions let him receive something
446,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He tried
447,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more problems and therefore earned the money.  Those were the rules.
448,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.50 to Participant X while allowing Participant Y to keep $2.65 because I believe in rewarding effort while still recognizing higher performance. Participant Y clearly outperformed X and deserves the majority of the earnings. However, Participant X did complete a significant number of problems, and a small redistribution acknowledges their effort without undermining the merit-based incentive structure. This approach aims to balance fairness, compassion, and motivation."
449,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X solved 8 problems, Y solved 15.According to the rules, Y earned $2.25, X earned $0.00.respects the original performance-based structure. It acknowledges that X still put in time and effort.  It adds a small fairness cushion without undermining Y's success."
450,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant X tried even though he came short. It is fair to recognize his efforts.
451,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to award participant X with the sum of 0.45 since they did solve part of the problems and contributed work though not as much as participant Y. It is only just to appreciate their work other than providing nothing to them. Meanwhile, I left the majority of the money with the participant Y as he evidently solved two times more problems. This manner, the reward continues to indicate how effectively every individual performed although it is a tad bit more equitable to the lower scorer."
452,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it would be most fair that participant X earn something for the questions they answered. I redistributed the earnings in a purely mathematical manner. There were 23 questions answered in total. $2.55 divided by 23 and multiplied by the 6 questions that participant X answered is (rounding to the second decimal place) $0.67.
453,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x tried his best and was close to person y
454,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i didn't see a reason for redistribution
455,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they answered almost equal number correctly but Y answered more.
456,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based on the given information, the  distribution of money between the two doesn't seem right and fair to me. X solved as half as what Y solved, so I felt it would be fair to give X a third of what Y got, hence the distribution."
457,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is because the person also did the work and had a few questions right therefore they deserve something small as much as they did not perform best.
458,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is act of kindness and best way to show good humanitarian effort despite not knowing who is participant Y
459,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that if everyone is doing the same survey then everyone should be paid the same
460,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not find any good reason why participant Y should share his/her earnings with participant X
461,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i distributed 1.8 to participant x because had done a third  of what participant y had done
462,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I  wanted it to be fair.
463,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clear: only the better performer earns money. Y solved more problems fairly. Changing that after the fact isnt fair to Y, so no money should be given to X."
464,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X got 17 correct answer while Y got 19. It seems unfair to me to award all the bonus to Y just based on the 2 extra questions gotten right. The 2 correct answers cannot be an enough gauge to determine the efforts put towards the study by either participant. A more fair outcome would be 1.35usd for X and 1.5usd for Y.
465,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My reason is based on fairness and empathy.
466,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was primarily motivated by fairness and the recognition of effort
467,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the gap in performance wasn't so wide. Participant X deserved a fraction of Y's earning.
469,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned more than X because it was stated that 15cents per correct answer to one who solves the most problems and nothing to the one that solves the least problems.
470,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In determining whether to redistribute earnings between Participant X and Participant Y, several key considerations guided my decision:    Minimal Effort Difference: The difference in the number of problems solved between the two participants was just one (12 vs. 13). Such a small discrepancy suggests that the effort expended was nearly identical, making a substantial earnings gap seem disproportionate.    Equity and Fairness Principles: Equity theory posits that individuals perceive fairness when rewards are proportional to contributions. In this context, the minimal difference in effort challenges the fairness of a significant earnings disparity."
471,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give the full amount to Participant X because I believe everyone who puts in effort should receive something, even if they didnt outperform their partner. The difference between their performances was small, and I felt it was fair to recognize both contributions equally rather than let one person walk away with nothing."
472,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute since the task was defined as performance based and competitive with both participants been aware beforehand.
473,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who accepted the task agreed to the rules. They only completed 12 tasks while the other completed 20. I don't think the person with 20 completed should give up earnings they rightfully (IMO) earned.
474,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   of the initial study
475,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just followed the original rules set
476,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X got many fewer answers correct compared to Person Y
477,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is because i felt like Y deserved to get more reward for doing a better job that X.This made me choose them because they tackled more than Y did.
478,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X still made a solid effort (13 correct answers!). A token portion from Y (e.g., $0.50 or $1) would acknowledge Xs contribution while still giving Y the bulk."
479,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the person who answered more won fair and square
480,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant X should get a reward for the five problems they solved.
481,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to pay the participant X 1.00 because I think that they should receive some compensation despite the fact they did not perform especially better as compared to other participants. This will motivate them to participate and even be rewarded with greater performance.
482,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   The performance difference isnt very extreme, and equalizing the rewards promotes fairness and also compassion."
483,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules stated that if one person didn't solve as many problems correctly as their partner, they wouldn't get any money. So I would find it unfair to take money from the person who earned it."
484,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give Participant X the full amount because they completed the task successfully and met the conditions for earning the reward. There was no reason to reduce their payment, and I believe people should keep what theyve fairly earned."
485,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured I would just split evenly between the two regardless of performance as this is the most equitable solution in my mind.
486,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My sole reason for giving participant X some of Participant Y's winnings is there was a close margin between the two and they both performed well. Regardless of the game's rules, I decided participant X was worth a reward for coming in at second place and participant Y the bigger piece of the cake for emerging victorious."
487,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because Y earned the amount in a fair manner
488,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x also deserved a reward as he or she had contributed in answering some questions.
489,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give participant X $1.25 as he worked as hard as participant Y. Only got one less problem solved.
490,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions stated that participants would only get paid if they did the same number of tasks as the other participants.  Redistributing the income would be against the instructions and that does not seem fair.
491,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the money by solving more problems, and both knew the rules from the start. It feels fair to let the results stand as they are."
492,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  One did slightly more work but does not mean that one should get nothing
493,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My main reason is to reduce the significant disparity in earnings between participant X and Y considering both participants contributed effort.
494,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well, based on the instructions and guidelines of the task, it will be more consistent with the design and expectations of the task to leave the earnings unchanged."
495,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the reward is based on merit. Then that means that person Y earned it and it would be unfair to just take a part of their reward and give it away without their consent.
497,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one who performed better deserves what he or she earned
498,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tried to make it a close enough proportionately. But not half.
499,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y earned their payment through effort and ability within the constraints of the task.
500,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  FOR PERSON X EFFORT, HE SHOULD BE PAID, BUT LESS THAN PERSON Y"
501,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to get the most profit
503,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X solved almost as many as the other participant
504,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants agreed beforehand that payment would only be received if they solved at least as many problems as their partner. Since Y solved more than X, That amount was given"
505,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This split the honors fairly while still rewarding stronger performance.
506,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to share a little bit of the funds but not all of it.
507,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I know the rule said you only get paid if you do better than the other person, and Y did better. But I still think X tried too and giving a little money is more fair and Y still get to keep most of it."
508,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason is that participant X solve some questions hence the participant deserver some compensation.
510,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved significantly more problems and earned their reward based on merit. But of a fair gesture solidarity, possibly acknowledging effort or external disadvantages."
512,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it was just to be fair
513,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned their earnings.  It is unjust to take.
514,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules and stakes were laid out to the participants prior to their completion of the tasks. If a participant failed to get the offered bonus, I am under no obligation to allot them oneespecially not if it takes away from another participant."
515,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i want participant Y to have a share also
516,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't want to penalize participant Y just because they did well on the problems. If participant Y did better than Participant X, then Participant Y deserves the full pay."
517,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to share the money because the rules were clear. Y solved more problems and earned it. X knew the rules too. It seems fair to keep it the way it was set.
518,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were very clear that the participants would only be paid if, in fact, they got more answers correct then the other participant, thus it is only fair that the payments be as stipulated."
519,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt person 1 dont deserve 0 since they did some work, but I didnt want to take too much from person 2"
520,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I looked at the ratio of the work done if 14 solutions earned him 2.1 then 5 solutions should earn X at least 0.3
523,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that offering a small portion to X recognizes their effort in participating, even with a lower score"
524,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the reason for my distribution is that team X also contributed to the task, i think the payment should not go to team Y only."
525,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that they should still be compensated for participating. They can get the extra cents made.
526,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think we should give someone else's earned money just to make them feel better.
527,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I saw that participant x received $0 and I believe in potential and I wanted to give them another chance and invest in their opportunity to try again.
529,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was based on performance through the efforts of the the participants.
530,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y should keep their full $2.70, and participant X should receive $0.00, as per the original terms of the task. This preserves the integrity of the incentive system and rewards performance as agreed."
531,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X didnt win. Therefore, the previous rule stated that participant X should not get any bonus. Its unfair if I take some from participant Y to give it to X."
532,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt bad leaving player X going home with nothing so I  decided to give him some money too
534,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reasons that motivated my decision were a combination of personal growth, alignment with my long-term goals, and a desire to take on new challenges."
535,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 from Y to X to acknowledge Xs solid effort while still respecting Ys superior performance. X performed above average, even though they didnt outperform Y. This small redistribution provides a token of fairness and recognition for effort, without significantly reducing the reward Y earned through higher achievement. It balances merit-based pay with a sense of fairness."
536,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The decision to redistribute 50% of participant Y's earnings is motivated by the relatively small performance difference between the two participants. While participant Y solved one more problem than participant X, the difference is marginal, and both performances are close to the average within the overall distribution."
537,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It would be unfair, since it is good to share some earnings to the other party."
538,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to allocate $0.50 of Ys earnings to X was motivated by a desire to promote fairness by acknowledging the performance difference between the participants, while also providing some support to the less successful participant"
539,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.55 to participant X because the performance difference between X and Y was very smalljust one correct answeryet the original rule created an all-or-nothing outcome. While Y did slightly outperform X and deserves to keep the majority of the reward, giving a small portion to X recognizes their strong effort and helps reduce the harshness of a total loss. This approach balances merit-based fairness with a sense of equity and proportionality."
542,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.30 to participant X to acknowledge their close effort while still rewarding Y's superior performance, balancing fairness, merit, and compassion without undermining the competition's rules."
543,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They earned their earnings according to their winnings and should be kept as such
544,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that person x answered almost have as many as y so they should get something.
546,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute because the rules were clear, and participant Y earned their reward fairly by outperforming X. Changing outcomes afterward would undermine fairness and agreed-upon incentives."
547,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  spread the wealth
548,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason that motivated me is that I think since  X solved some problems too it would be fair to give him some amount
549,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they knew about instructions given before they take the test.
551,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well, at the beginning both participants were made completely aware of the rules and the stake and they both agreed to participate under those rules. following the rules, participant x made nothing while y made their fair amount."
552,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the thought of giving to others
553,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give half the earnings to the person that received 0 dollars.
554,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the workers knew the rules when the did the task and work . It would be unfair for me to change the rules that they agreed to when they started the study.
555,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They all participate, and in every game there must be a person who score higher than the other."
556,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give about 25%
557,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although they didnt get the most, they deserved some of the payment"
558,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe i equal distribution, and i wanted both to have equal values, without discriminating either"
559,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the fact that the participant participated should be remunerated
561,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason that motivated my decision is the act of being fair and moral, I try to strike a balance and make sure that the distribution doesn't just go to one person. I acknowledged the effort of the other participant, that was why I made the distribution, the participant solved some problems too and therefore, needs to earn like participant Y. I try to reward the participant for their handwork too and not only allow one participant to have it all, Like I said, I was motivated my being fair in my decision and rewarding everyone for their input and effort."
562,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Honestly, I balanced merit and fairness: Y deserves most reward for superior performance, but X earned some recognition for effort. $0.50 splits the difference reasonably."
563,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   or try to even things out.
564,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although they did not get as many questions correct, they should get some compensation."
565,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the other participant deserved at least something for their effort and that that was fair
566,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X took time to do the study. Maybe he/she had a problem with completing the questions.
567,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   While Participant Y performed significantly better and deserved more, I believe its fair to recognize Participant Xs effort with a small portion. This promotes a balance between rewarding merit and reducing extreme inequality."
568,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although Participant Y solved 16 problems and Participant X solved 12 problems, I feel both should be compensated. Participant X should get something for solving the problems although they did not complete as many."
569,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I like to make things half and X and Y were close in their correct answers.  If they were further apart, I would have given less to X."
570,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision places a high priority on following the rules, which the participants were aware of in advance.  Participant X earned nothing, but Participant Y earned $2.40 for meeting the performance level.  Respecting these conditions guarantees equity, openness, and honors the effort that was initially expressed, all of which are consistent with my personal and professional principles."
571,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though Participant X didn't get any right answers there still should be some compensation for their time and effort.
572,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  if solving 21 problems participant y gets 3.15 us that means solving 10 problems x should be granted 1.5 USD
574,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to redistribute a portion of Participant Y's earnings to Participant X was motivated by fairness and empathy. Although Participant Y solved slightly more problems, the performance gap was minimal, and both participants put in effort to complete the task. Since Participant X received nothing under the original payment rule, transferring a modest amount helps reduce the disparity and acknowledges X's effort. This promotes a sense of equity and ensures that neither participant is left with nothing, which can lead to a more satisfying and just outcome for both parties involved."
575,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like both participants should be paid something for the study. However, since Y solved twice as many as X, then Y should get paid twice as much as X."
576,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the other person done good to.
577,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i would wish to award the person X more the effort that they made in the task.
579,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think getting nothing on a score of 13 to 14 is just unfair so my decision is just awarding the effort of all the participants
580,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Giving the other participant that amount is a generous thing to do.
581,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to
582,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want to leave it as is as it is not my place to choose how much to give each person.
583,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  if you already told the participants how the money will be distributed prior in the study, you should not change the rules. The participant who struggled the most should get the full amount with no shortcuts"
584,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told up front that there would be no compensation if you were last
585,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I FELT IT WAS A FAIR AMOUNT
586,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i did not want participant x to go with nothing so i decided to split the money
587,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X deserves something, but they also did considerably less than Participant Y."
588,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  2.25 divided by the total number of questions answered multiplied by 11 = .95
589,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The initial rules of the survey about payment motivated my decision.
590,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think its fair to not be compensated for spending all the time doing the puzzles and especially when they got nearly the same outcome as the other person so I assume put in similar or at least enough effort to perform as well.
591,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did almost as well and deserved some compensation, but not as much as Y."
592,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that everyone read the instructions before engaging in the study and that they needed to do well so that they get points. So there is no need to re evaluate the point system.
594,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant that solved more deserved all the bonus because they did better than the other participant
595,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is because the performance-based system acknowledges Xs effort and the reality that small differences in performance shouldn't always mean total loss. Its a gesture of fairness without fully overriding the original terms.
596,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decisions prioritize adhering strictly to the explicit rules established for participants. Redistributing earnings without a clear, pre-defined rationale for doing so would be arbitrary and unfair to the participant who earned their money according to the communicated terms."
598,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My primary motivation is to uphold the explicit rules given to participants. Participant Y earned their payment according to the stated terms, and redistributing those earnings without a clear, pre-established justification would be arbitrary and unfair to them."
599,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I choose to give $0.60 of participant Y's earnings to participant X.  This way:  Participant X receives $0.60 for a solid effort (9 correct answers),  Participant Y retains $1.20 for outperforming (12 correct answers),  The decision reflects a balance between merit-based reward and recognition of effort, avoiding the harshness of a full zero payoff for X."
600,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x  was short of 2
601,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted the distribution to be somehow fair.Particant X getting 0.0 share was not fair to me.atleast awarding participant x will make the share distribution relative.
602,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give participant x 0.50 USD because the gap between their score was that minimal.
603,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like participant y really put in the effort and therefore deserves all that they earned.  Though participant x answered some correctly, they knew that they might not get any money, and they were not as good as y."
605,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was based on the fact that both participated and the chances that one would end up with nothing and one would end up with all would not be fair. The amount was able to be split to a more even amount for both participants. Also, I feel according to the rules the winner should still benefit more than the loser and thought that something slightly more/less than half would be sufficient enough. This is all due to the fact that I , being the decision maker, is aware of the rules for the participants of the previous study."
606,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Considering the participant did 7 problems, it would be fair if the other participant share at least some amount"
607,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe it is fair to be paid per correct answer.
609,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  wanted to be  fair
610,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant X solved fewer problems, while participant Y solved at least many problems. based on this performance, participant X earned 0.0 and participant Y earned 2.69999999999997"
611,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think the bonus rules were fair and I wanted both participants to leave with something. I did want to reward the participant who did really well though, so they still get most of the bonus."
612,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  14 did almost the same as 15, so it seems a bit more fair for the money to be evened up a little, although 15 still gets the most since they outperformed"
613,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though participant X scored much lesser than Y, he/she still made effort and earned something from the scores. I think he/she deserves some payment from the small effort applied and scores gained"
614,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give both people something
615,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because of the work done its fare to share
617,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did more than X in this scenario so they should keep all their earnings
618,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was trying to be fair in distributing the winnings.
620,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Going into the job / survey the rules clearly stated that participant X to get paid needed to answer as many questions as participant Y.  This did not occur so it would not be fair to participant Y to after the fact take money away from them.
621,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give Participant X \$1.00 because, although they did not perform as well as Participant Y, they still put in effort and completed a significant number of problems. This partial redistribution recognizes their contribution while still rewarding Participant Y for their higher performance. It strikes a balance between fairness and merit."
622,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that paying zero was unlucky and unfair although its determined on luck per say, I feel a little amount is better than nothing."
623,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   Y solved significantly more problems and earned the reward according to the rules set in advance. Redistributing earnings would undermine the fairness of the performance based system, where rewards are tied to individual effort and achievement."
624,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be fair to each participant
625,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should receive some compensation for the number of problems that they answered.
626,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute any of Participant Ys earnings because they clearly outperformed Participant X. The rules were fair and known in advance, and I believe people should be rewarded based on their effort and results. Taking away Ys earnings wouldnt feel right or justifiedÂ inÂ thisÂ case."
627,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like 1 dollar was a fair amount and would end up with both receiving at least something.
629,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While I think the player that got more right deserves more I still think the player with less deserves more than nothing.
630,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided that they also deserve to get a share of the amount rather than keeping all for Participant Y despite solving more problems that Participant X. Thus, I decided for better performance Y gets to keep $2 and gives $1.15 to X."
631,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i think that both participants deserved a share of the amount because they took their time to solve the problems
632,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Splitting the earnings evenly acknowledges both participants efforts while maintaining the studys competitive points. It promotes fairness to both without fully overriding the rules of the study.
633,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They completed close to the amount of the other person so I thought they should get something.   However the other person completed more so they should have gotten the majority
634,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X and y acted independently of each other and x didnt deserve any of ys earnings because they didnt help them earn it.
635,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I mean it said in the rules the people were told that if they did not solve as many problems as the other person they would not receive any bonus.  So they knew going in they could end up with a bonus of $0 so why punish the person that did better by taking some of their money and giving it to the other participant.  Not only would that be punishing the person that did better but it would show that you lied and showed deceit in your original instructions since you were not letting the person that answered 21 questions keep the money earned.
636,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was influenced because everyone did the job and each of them need token of appreciation
637,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That's the best fair and equitable share distribution.
638,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's only fair that everyone gets what they've worked for
639,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   you may respond with overarching ambitions like success, happiness, or self-fulfillment."
640,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe this amount is fair and I would think so from their perspective.
642,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y person solved more tasks, this means they deserve the money more than someone who did less work."
643,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y should earn more, but participant X should also earn something."
644,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of participant Ys earnings because the rules were clearly stated upfront: only the participant who solved at least as many problems as their partner would earn money. Participant Y performed better and earned their payment fairly. Changing the outcome afterward would undermine the fairness and purpose of the original incentive structure, which was designed to reward effort and performance."
645,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I stuck with the person answering less questions got zero
646,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Before the start off the study, both participants were notified of the rules. As such, each participant is aware that in case they get fewer answers right in comparison to the other, they get nothing. For getting 14 questions right, Participant Y got $2.1 which is $0.15 per question. If Participant X got as many questions right as Y then it would be a contest but in this case the rules are clear. The decision to share the cash should come from Participant Y since they got the most questions right, otherwise it is unjust to deduct from their prize."
648,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  10 questions correct was a lot
649,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well, since Y did answer a lot of questions and earned it, then it is theirs, they deserve it. X also deserves something for their effort and correct answers, but since they knew what the consequences were and still kept on, then I guess that is what they deserve. IF you don't like options, don't go along with it. You do the work that's what you earned, so both should get something but I'm not taking away from one that did work also."
650,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I choose to give participant x 0.60 because he/she answered correctly
652,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While I would have liked to have given some money to the other participant, it didn't seem fair to take away money from the person that did indeed complete the most tasks. Even though they knew there might be a possibility that their earnings would change, I still didn't feel right about lowering the winner's earnings."
653,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it would be fair to contribute something rather than the other contestant receiving nothing at all.
654,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give them something but not too much of an amount.
655,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it is basically about the fineness and clarity of the rules
656,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that each participant did a fair amount of solved problems and therefor I thought it only fair to divide the amount evenly between the two participants.
657,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were explained, and the person with more correct answers should get the reward that was promised to them."
658,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe the distribution was not fairly allocated
661,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it rewarded Participant X fairly for the 60% they answered correctly.
662,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were laid out at the start. Everyone knew what they signed up for.
663,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who solved more problems shoul dbe able to keep what they earned. They both had the same chances to solve the puzzles and rewarded the person who did more.
664,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the instructions state that the person who solves fewer puzzles will get nothing, but I feel empathy for the person who solved fewer puzzles as they did not solve zero and should be compensated for their time. however, they solved very few puzzles which makes me feel that the amount allocated to them should be proportional and very low."
665,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by a balance between recognizing the competitive outcome and acknowledging effort. While Participant Y earned the money based on the study's rules and superior performance, Participant X also completed a significant number of problems (12), representing valuable effort. Redistributing a portion allowed for a more equitable compensation for X's work while still rewarding Y for their higher achievement."
666,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Given that they all made efforts to solve the problem and that, I believe each should be paid based on the efforts made"
667,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant also took part and deserved to be awarded
668,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both participated, X solved 10 problems and Y solvelved12 problems so it is fair that they both receive some payment"
669,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I based it on the proportion of work done by participant X: 13/31 solved problems times the overall profit.
670,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt t was fair to share the earnings since both participants put in effort and te gap wasn't too big. It's a balance between rewarding work and being considerate.
671,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I selected to give away the amount of $0.75 of Participant Y to Participant X to reconcile fairness and merit. Whereas Participant Y managed to solve all 16 problems and receive the complete reward according to the rules of the experiment, the irritated Participant X also showed a considerable effort having solved 16 problems. By paying X a small percentage of the profits Y receives, one does not take away much of what Y is entitled to, but still acknowledges his or her work effort. This small redistribution does not affect the integrity of the system of incentives, but demonstrates empathy towards a person who did his best but failed. It is a preference that would indicate that efforts should be rewarded to some degree even where the rules of performance imply otherwise. Justice may be based on result and effort."
673,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should be compensated for the work that they did, but Y worked really hard to complete much more.  I gave them a little bit but Y earned their pay."
674,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute earnings because the payment rules were clearly explained to both participants before the task, and they agreed to them. Participant Y performed better and earned their payment fairly under those conditions. Redistributing the earnings after the fact would undermine the merit-based structure and the incentive for effort."
675,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My motivation is based on upholding the original rules of the study. Participant Y met the conditions to earn money, and transferring their earnings without a clear, stated reason for redistribution would be unfair and contradict the initial agreement."
676,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the person who solved more problems should get the majority of the money, but the other person must have tried in order to get 14 questions correct."
677,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like as it was explained to the participants if they did not complete more patterns than the other participant they would get nothing.
678,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they do not deserve it
679,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  now that participant X also participated it was fair to atleast award him/her something
680,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   is ridiculous. There are a myriad of reasons why one participant may do better on a task than another and to penalize one participant for that is ludicrous and unfair. Presuming both participants tried their best and did the same task, I feel the monies should be applied equally (I'm a huge fan of wealth and income equality in general, and it applies here as well.)"
681,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The number of problems solved correctly weren't that far off. I think it is fair.
683,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It wouldn't be fair for the participant who answered correct answers to give their earnings to someone who didn't answer correctly. If we knew that the participant tried to answer and just didn't get it correctly, or if they just chose answers just to choose that would make a difference. I would expect the same, and if it was me I wouldn't expect anything if I didn't answer correctly."
684,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was based on the principle of fairness within clearly communicated rules. Both participants entered the task knowing that rewards depended on relative performance. Participant Y solved more problems and rightfully earned the payment, while Participant X did not meet the threshold for a reward. Redistributing Ys earnings would unfairly penalize higher performance and distort the incentive structure. Upholding the original terms respects both participants' expectations and maintains the integrity of the experiment."
685,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.30 to Participant X to recognize their strong effortsolving 12 problems is a solid performance, even if it wasnt the highest. At the same time, I wanted to maintain a performance-based reward system, so I ensured Participant Y, who outperformed, kept the majority of their earnings. This decision balances fairness, effort, and merit."
687,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered 14 questions and Participation Y 19.  Answers correct were close Participation X should get something they.
688,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is fair for the rules told to the participants be the rules that are followed.
689,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the game was played fairly and one person did better
690,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not choose to redistribute any of participant Y's earnings based on very clear rules from the beginning-the participants would only be paid if they performed as well as if not better than their partner. Both participants agreed to those terms, and Y earned the money correctly by doing better than X. To alter the outcome now would cast an undeserving shadow of doubt on the fairness and transparency of the agreement that had been initially reached."
691,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was a pretty big difference when it came to how many each person solved, so I didn't think it was fair to make it perfectly equal. But I still thought each participant should earn something for the work that they did."
692,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules stated that no money would be given if the participant solved fewer problems than the other participant. Based on the rules, I saw no reason to award any money to Participant X."
693,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to respect the given rules which had specific payment conditions. To also ensure that trust is maintained within the process. Moreover, participant Y had performed better."
694,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because participant y did his work correctly
696,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Target audience reach  Chose channels that connect best with the intended customers.  Cost-effectiveness  Selected options that offer value for money.  Product nature  Matched the distribution method with the type of product (e.g., perishable, luxury, mass-market).  Speed and convenience  Prioritized fast and reliable delivery or access."
697,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided participant x should receive a little less than half to distribute it equally based on participation
698,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to transfer $1.20 to Participant X to partially reduce the income gap, even though Participant Y performed slightly better. While the task rewarded higher performance, the difference between 15 and 17 problems solved is relatively small. Sharing a portion of the earnings helps acknowledge Participant Xs solid effort, promotes fairness, and reduces the harshness of an all-or-nothing reward systemespecially when both participants performed above average."
699,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  All or Nothing  Proportionality    The 15 vs. 17 performance gap is relatively small (Y solved ~13% more problems). A near-total earnings disparity feels disproportionate. Splitting the difference roughly in half (while still favoring Y) aligns rewards more closely with the actual difference in performance
700,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X showed good results and should receive a small bonus
701,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because participant X tried , 11 is not much far to 16 so she deserves a little payment of it."
702,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just wanted to give everyone the same payout. It seems quite unfair that someone would get 0, despite solving a few problems."
703,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The difference between the two was 1 and that means even participant x did the best
704,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be fair and they both solved almost the same amount of problems. I rewarded the one that solved more with a little more money to be fair.
705,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's because i feel participant x also did a good job for gaining 14 points. I felt it was unfair for him to earn 0 points.
706,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason that motivated my decision was being fair to both participant. This is to ensure that both of them are being paid no matter  how little.
707,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main argument which I used was that the difference in performance was actually very small, only 1 problem out of 24. That type of gap might well be little more than not being in the right place at the right time or getting a unlucky moment in on one question instead of going there being a noticeable difference in talent.When taking a look at the chart, it follows that the two participants exhibited better results over average than all the other participants in the study. Both of them are obviously capable so it did not seem right to run one man into the ground and leave the other man with nothing on such a small margin of difference.I also considered what I would feel in that case, say 14 problems figured out and a person got 15, I would expect some whit that I did a good job too. It seemed too harsh that close difference to use a winner-take-all approach. It was more equitable to divide it but at the same time please the better performer with a little extra."
708,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   criterion.
710,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both knew the rules going into the game. There is no expectation of taking from the one who earned the reward and giving to the one who did not. Why would I strive to win if I know that I will receive a prize anyway. Why would I strive to win if I know my prize will be lower than promised.
711,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should still ear something for answering there questions correctly.
713,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X has a higher pay compared to Y. So I chose not to distribute
714,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I paid proportately to performance: approximately 75% to 25%.
715,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Thank you for asking for my response, because my response is important to me. It is critical to understand that all data contributed by participants in labor now, in this digital era we all inhabit, is valuable and that to extract it without compensation is an exploitation. Nowhere in the information provided for the determination of reward for this activity did it say that the faster worker would be the more accurate of the two workers, and both their labor is being utilized even if one participant's data is not determined the set for implementation, for any reason. To ask workers to engage in labor necessitates a compensation, and if I am worker Y I will expect to share my reward for labor with the other worker, whose work is not necessarily less valuable than my own. Thank you for this opportunity to respond to the task presented. I appreciate the opportunity to be involved in important information-gathering and decision-making projects such as this one."
716,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y scored the highest points and deserves all the earnings.
718,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute earnings because I believe in recognizing performance based on the established rules. Participant Y definitely outperformed Participant X, and our payment system made it clear that earnings depended on solving at least as many problems as the other participant. If we were to redistribute the earnings, it would hurt the motivation for everyone involved. Its important to maintain that connection between effort, how well someone does their job, and the rewards they receive. Keeping things fair encourages everyone to work harder and do their best. I hope this helps illustrate my thinking behind the decision."
719,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to reward effort while still respecting performance. X didnt win, but they tried, so a small amount feels fair without taking too much from Y, who earned the full reward."
720,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i strikely followed the rules which i was given before whereby earning is based on performance
721,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   still gets the majority of the compensation. Although there is still something to be said for leaving things as is.
722,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Conduct surveys and hold regular meetings to gather feedback.  Offer distributors rewards for submitting sales and customer data such as invoices and warranty registrations.
723,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the distribution was known before the experiment began, there is not any reason to re-distribute the money"
725,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I SHARE FOR THIS SAME TO THE X. TO DONATE THE MAXIMUN AMOUNT OF X.
726,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The modest redistribution finds a balance between merit (Y still receives a lot more for superior performance) and fairness (X doesn't leave with nothing at all).
729,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved significantly more problems and earned the reward based on the established rules. I chose not to redistribute earnings because the outcome was fair and merit-based.
730,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am motivated by showing appreciation to the participant for all they did.
731,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one participant guessed slightly less correct, so I felt like they deserved some money, but not fully half."
732,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although x didn't do as many as y did.  He did do almost as many.  I felt he should get slightly less than half of y earnings.
734,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wouldn't want to give someone else's funds away.
736,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think Participant X deserves some compensation because their effort was nearly as good as Y's.
737,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt person X deserved some compensation, but not as much as person Y. I decided $0.50 was enough"
739,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The fact that participate Y solved a lot more problems than participate X motivated my decision
740,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though one participant scored less they still did the tasks and completed them
741,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't necessarily want to give away someone else earnings because that person did do better.
743,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved 16 questions so he deserved more more but X solved just few questions so he deserved lesser than X
744,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am highly interested in learning and finding out new new opinions that might differ from mine
746,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was just trying to make it even. They both tried hard.
747,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They still answered 17
748,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because he should get something for 11 answers right
749,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I based my decision on the chart presented, as both X and performed averagely well and it is only fair that they both share the money"
750,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason for my decision is that the instructions to the participants were clear that if X did not correctly solve at least many as Y, then X would receive zero dollars. The participants agreed to participate under those rules."
751,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i was motivated just to show appreciation for participation
752,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like it was fair to give a little bit to the other participant because their partner had the highest score out of everyone which felt a little unfair.
753,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Due to the loser performing better than most other participants and only missing out by two points. They deserve something.
755,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason that motivated my distribution is a combination of various factors
757,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because X  has solved 8 problems correctly
758,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X did fewer tasks person Y.
759,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who answered fewer questions right tried their best and gave a few good correct answers. I thought they should be rewarded for their efforts. Something that wouldn't take away too much from the person who got 18 answers correct.
761,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 7 problems, showing meaningful engagement, even though Y outperformed them."
763,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants knew the rules and I am just enforcing them.
764,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x earned what he deserves
765,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants were only one question answered apart, so it seemed fair to me to distribute a little less than half of Y's earnings to X."
766,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's fair that the one who got almost double the amount of correct answers gets the whole promised bonus. After all the other person seems like they put in lower effort.
767,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the relative effort and performance of both participants
770,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X only answered 3 less questions than Participant Y, they should also earn something."
771,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did not put much energy and concentration that was needed for the task, so my decision of giving out $0.25 that is just for participation."
772,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It will be best to make the candidate have a feel of some rewards to make the candidate try harder
773,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to offer earnings to participant X because it would be wholly unfair to participant Y.
775,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that the instructions were clear for the two participates and I was happy to stick to those
776,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should be awarded accordingly. What they realy deserve to be paid.
777,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to redistribute a small portion because I value fairness and want to recognize that X still made an effort. While Y earned more by performing better, I believe sharing a bit doesnt take away from meritit just adds a touch of empathy to the outcome."
778,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both parties knew the conditions going in. It's not appropriate for me to intervene
779,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Althought the participant had less, and the rules were agreed on, I feel like its an unfair process."
780,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't think it was fair that they did solve some problems but didn't get anything.
782,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute earnings because Participant Y performed significantly better than Participant X and earned their reward according to the rules both agreed to beforehand. Redistributing would undermine the fairness of a system based on relative performance and would penalize Y despite their superior results. Upholding the original rules maintains consistency and respects the integrity of the task.
783,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Sharing is a powerful and positive act, just showing care and  kindness"
784,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Money is just paper.
785,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants understood the rules of the task before they started.  It may be argued that it is not fair to participant X to do that much work and receive no compensation, but they understood the situation going in.  Participant Y should not be punished for doing better as those were the rules."
786,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is not fair that someone who solved 9 does not get compensated for their effort.
787,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted the person X to take $1 while the person Y take 1.25 and it will all base on the task
789,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's only fair to get the share since he participated.
790,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe the participant tried by answering some questions correctly and need to be motivated
791,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  even though they did not do as well as the other person, they tried"
792,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They still answered questions correctly, so they should be compensated."
793,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like the person who only answered two correctly should be compensated for their time.
794,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more problems, so only Y earned money. The rules say only the higher or equal scorer gets paid"
795,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y will still receive more which reflects his achievement and score while Participant X will get a token of appreciation for participation.
796,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that Participant X should receive some money, since they finished several problems. But they shouldn't get as much money as Participant Y, because Participant Y solved more problems than X."
798,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe in balancing merit with fairness. Participant Y deserves the majority of earnings for significantly outperforming X, but transferring a small portion ensures X is not left empty-handed. This approach rewards effort while maintaining the incentive for strong performance."
801,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  at least each to have an amount
802,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were explained before and only the possibility that there could be a change.  The person made the decision based on the information at the time and I see no reason to change it.
803,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should still received something  for getting questions right
804,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Without any direction and left to my own decision making I felt that since it was close that the other participant deserved some of the money. I felt I gave the winner enough extra for finishing first vs what I gave to the other player.
806,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I made the decision not to redistribute Ys earnings to X because the structure of this task clearly rewarded performance. those who solved more problems resulted in higher earnings.
807,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant had to receive $0.1 because it's fair.
808,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Reward winners proportionally
809,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt both participants were aware of the rules and the conditions upon which the payoffs would be made and they both knew that their skill/accuracy was important and this was a competition where the loser would receive nothing.
810,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x participated and answered 8 questions, as a little reward for taking part in the participation."
811,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is a valid float (1.00), meets the minimum requirement ( 0), and still leaves participant Y with 1.40 USD. Its a fair middle-ground choice based on their nearly equal efforts."
812,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y won, but I wanted to give something to X."
814,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x fell of the cut off score i'm  only doing him a favor by giving him some amount from Y's portion
815,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Looking at the distribution it is clear to me that player x worked hard and put in effort. I don't think it is fair that reward is only tied to success. While a higher reward being given to Y for being more successful is fine, I think as long as both players made an effort there should be some reward, that feels more fair to me. Therefore I have X $1 because that felt like a more fair allocation to me."
816,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y answered more questions correctly. I believe it was only fair to have him keep his share.
817,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants knew the rules that were in place before partaking. I simply abided by those rules and awarded the person who completed more. There's no punishment as the expectation should be clear to both participants.
818,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   you may respond with overarching ambitions like success, happiness, or self-fulfillment."
819,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it would fair to strike an average distribution of their earnings between the two participants.
821,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute because both participants agreed to performance-based rewards. Participant Y earned their payment fairly, and changing the outcome would undermine the original incentive structure."
823,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Fairness and equal sharing
824,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My distribution decision was motivated by a combination of fairness, efficiency, and team impact. I aimed to allocate resources in a way that would maximize benefit for the overall team, while also considering individual needs or concerns that were raised. I also took into account how the distribution would affect morale, workflow, and long-term goals, striving to make a decision that felt balanced and justifiable to everyone involved."
825,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My main motivation for choosing to give Participant X 0.50 USD from Participant Y's earnings is based on a blend of acknowledging effort/participation and promoting a degree of fairness, while still respecting the difference in performance."
826,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that its fair that the other participants gets some money for the work that they did.
827,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that participant y earned the money, period"
828,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved significantly more problems than participant X, and thus rightfully earned the payout."
831,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason for the decision is to motivate the other participant for participating.
833,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While Participant Y clearly outperformed Participant X, solving 24 problems compared to 7, Participant X still put in effort and contributed to the task. Redistributing $0.60 acknowledges Participant X's effort while maintaining a fair reflection of the performance gap between the two participants. This approach balances reward for effort with recognition of superior performance."
835,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participants X has also solved more than half of the problems solved by participants Y
836,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered 24% of the correct answers and should be paid 24% of the payout.
837,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They deserve to to be compensated for their work too
839,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted it to be a fair meritocracy.  X solved problems and should be compensated.  Y did much better and should be compensated more, but not to the exclusion of X, who made a contribution."
841,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I added a total of all completed tasks and then did a ratio of Participants Y tasks over total multiplied by the amount to be shared. 19/34 by 2.85= 1.59
842,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of Ys earnings to X because: 1. Both participants accepted a clear, performance-based payment structure before starting the task. Upholding these rules ensures fairness and preserves the integrity of the experiment. 2. Y solved more problems and earned the reward through superior performance. Redistributing earnings would penalize Y despite their success."
845,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based on the fact that Y performed way better than X, the Y deserves all the money"
846,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It simply felt fair
847,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X did 1/3 of the work, they deserve something."
848,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The primary reason for not redistributing any of participant Y's earnings is to uphold the original, performance-based agreement. Participants were clearly informed that their earnings depended on solving at least as many problems as their matched partner. Participant Y solved significantly more problems (17 vs. 10), fairly earning the $2.55.    Redistributing earnings after the task would undermine the rules participants agreed to beforehand and could be seen as unfair to those who performed better. Maintaining the integrity of the incentive structure respects both participants' expectations and reinforces merit-based outcomes in competitive tasks."
850,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X tried t get at least 14 which is not far from 18. X deserves some reward.
852,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just feel compensating x 1.1 will motivate them more
853,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since X earned 2.1, I decided to simply give half of it to Y. That way they both have an equal amount."
854,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to transfer earnings because participant Y obviously outperformed participant X, solving nearly twice as many tasks. The original payment structure rewards superior performance, which promotes effort and fairness. Redistributing wages to participant X notwithstanding the performance discrepancy may weaken motivation and the merit-based compensation principle."
856,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel it would be fair if Y got an even $3 and X got a 30 cent effort reward
857,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both worked hard and deserve some compensation for their efforts.
858,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to ensure that the initial rules continued to be followed.
862,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  although participant X did not answer as  more question as participant Y did , they at least answered something correct"
863,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered way fewer questions than participant Y hence it could be unfair if we distributed participant Y's earnings.
864,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X only had one less correct answer than Y so I felt that they deserved this amount, almost half of what Y earned."
865,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The earnings were to be distrubuted to the one who solve most questions
866,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x deserved something to appreciate the effects used to attain the marks
867,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since Participant Y resolved a lot more difficulties than Participant X, Y should be compensated in full. The difference in their performance would not be reflected if the earnings were redistributed."
868,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Paticipant X did not get many problems solved but it seemed like they tried. So I decided to give them a fifth of participant Ys earnings.
869,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did solve a few problems, so I want to give them something, but participant Y clearly did much more work and put in a lot of effort, so I want to make sure they get the bulk of the money still."
870,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by the attempt to contribute. X did make an attempt to answer questions.
871,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In light of the analysis, along with the performance data, I propose that 0.75 USD be taken out of the income of participant Y to participants X, leaving Y with 2.10 USD and X with 0.75 USD. This helps to strike the fine balance between the efforts of X and the better performance of Y."
872,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant X equally did well and should be rewarded for his/her effort and time dedicated to task. having answered 16 correctly was very rewarding just as Y answered 17 correctly so to be fair, I just thought to reward him/her a little lower than Y"
873,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the person did a good job answering 9 correct and it would suck to not get anything
874,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think both participants did about the same. The difference was not very much, so I wanted the reward to be almost even."
875,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X didn't earn it.
876,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like the participant deserved something even though the rules stated they would receive nothing. They did a large number of the tasks so I felt a small bonus was deserved.
877,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute a small portion of participant Ys earnings (0.6 USD) to participant X to ensure that X receives some compensation for their effort, even though they solved fewer problems. While Y clearly outperformed X and deserves the majority of the reward, I believe a modest redistribution promotes fairness and acknowledges that both participants contributed to the task. This balance respects merit while avoiding a complete exclusion of participant X."
878,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were not that far off from their score difference so the other candidate deserved a little token of appreciation.
879,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There were 24 problems and the person only solved 6.  That's not even trying.  You could get 6 by guess the same answer for every problem.
880,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think 9 right is a decent effort and they should get something for getting that many right
881,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y was clearly better prepared and deserves the full amount
883,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want person Y to keep all the money.
885,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I placed myself in the shoes of participant X, he/she tried the best he could. So I thought it would be fair for him/her to get a small cut for the effort."
886,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   outlook.
887,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted participant X to get a fair share of the money.
888,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they did not get a zero, they deserve something."
889,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't think it was fair for one participant to receive payment and the other one receives nothing. I wanted the participant that answered less questions to at least receive some payment so that is why I decided to send over 50 cents.
891,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  As X did so close to Y answering correctly, I thought it only fair they should receive almost half."
892,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To be honest, I was having some technical issues and was trying to type a different amount in there, however the error message prompt kept telling me I could not. I was trying to put in for half."
893,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i want to give a small amount but not too much
894,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think both participants deserve about the same amount, since they both spent the same amount of time on the study. Yes, I know it's a game, and when you lose, you lose, but since my part in the game is part of the rules, I want each of them to have a fair chance. I know I left a little more for X, and that's because he did actually win."
895,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i considered it fair if the payments were made according to the number of problems each particiopant solved
896,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It didn't feel fair that Y got everything, but it was X's earnings, so giving at least part of the earnings felt OK."
898,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant put more effort in and earned their pay
899,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of the original task was clearly stated as a 'competition' and both participants agreed to the terms.  The winner takes all, and loser gets zero.  A tie would be very fortunate indeed where both would get paid.  In the case of excellence, where both participants solved all of the problems, they would both get rewarded for their excellence.  I see no reason to change the payments from this original premise of one-on-one competition."
902,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X didn't receive anything for answering questions and was in 2nd place of answering question.  X deserves something.
903,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  in every score will be willing to donate 1
904,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because of their very narrow performance difference (one issue out of 24), I decided to give Participant X $0.50 and let Participant Y keep $2.05.  Although I appreciate the merit-based system and think it's critical to honor hard work and accomplishment, I also understand that rigid winner-take-all results might seem excessively harsh when there is little difference.  In addition to easing the financial impact on X, this partial redistribution recognizes Y's superior performance, encouraging equity and mutual appreciation of effort."
905,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's healthy competition where the winner takes it all.
906,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y performed better and earned the money fairly. Giving X anything feels unjustified.
907,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The second participant did way better than the first, so I thought they deserved way more money. Still, the first participant did do some of the work, so I wanted to make sure they got something for it, even if it was a very small amount."
908,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved more of the problems, so therefore they should receive more of the compensation."
910,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to reward hard work, i gave less to participant X because he did not solve enough problems"
913,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Seemed a fair amount, the user answered almost as many questions, gave the user who answered more querstions a slightly higher ratio"
914,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i wanted to appreciate participant X's efforts and minimize the harshness of the outcomes
915,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  since they all participated, it is only fair that they both get something. Participant Y will still have a dollar and the other participant can have 50 cents, atleast they will feel motivated."
916,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The number of questions answered by each
917,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that would be the best decision for me.
918,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X solved more problems than Y.
919,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Wasn't sure what to do
920,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i believe everyone should be rewarded equally to what they achieved in the task
922,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The terms were clearly laid out and there was no deception.
923,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because participant x also solved some quizes correctly and it would be unfair if he received nothing at all
924,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the candidate that score higher earns higher
925,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told the rules before participating, and they still decided to participate. Participant X knew they may receive $0, and participant Y earned their money. It was fair."
926,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt participant X should have some little cents
927,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to transfer $1.00 because I wanted to balance fairness and merit. While participant Y performed better and deserves to keep a significant portion of the earnings, participant X also made a substantial effort by solving 10 problems. Transferring part of Ys earnings to X acknowledges Xs effort without fully equalizing the outcomes, maintaining some reward for better performance while reducing the harshness of an all-or-nothing result."
928,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that the first participant, X did try their best and wasn't that far behind Y, and so deserved some compensation"
929,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think the other person should get the money person Y worked hard for.
930,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems like Participant X didn't really try, so they don't deserve anything from Participant Y's earnings they worked for."
932,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I went with the original statement concerning payment.
933,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason that motivated my decision is fairness. Participant X deserved something at least for correctly answering some of the questions.
934,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were clearly told the rules before they participated, so when they were playing they were fully aware that it was a winner takes all kind of challenge. It would be very unfair to participant Y to redistribute their winnings after all the effort they put in to earn it."
935,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant y solved more problems so they should keep all their earnings because thats fair and just
937,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   made that decision because participant y answered more questions meaning the participant was more determined than participant x, and the efforts of participant y deserve the rewards received. Participant x should try harder next time to earn the reward"
938,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is unfair for participant X to get nothing at all after the effort this person used
939,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I needed to be fair and help the other participant too
940,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was a shame to have to people who did well against each other but those are the breaks. I didn't want to change the outcome because I think we need to reward winning.
941,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it would be fair if they got something
942,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  my motivation was that we all have different capabilities, and so if the other participant was not able to perform as many tasks, it does not mean the participant should not get anything"
944,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave participant x a small bonus for their effort.
945,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I choose not to redistribute any of Ys earnings because Y followed the rules, performed better, and deserves the full amount based on their effort."
946,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought participant X should get something for answering 3 questions correctly but that Y should still get a majority of their bonus.
947,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X was in the top 75 percentile, and it was just misfortune that they were up against Y.  In most cases X would have received compensation."
948,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved the most puzzles and those were the original rules. X already knows they may not receive any money.
949,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This decision is in line with the rules provided for the first part of the activity. I dont see any reason to go against them.
950,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The score difference of participant X and Y and not far apart.
951,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it was only fair to split my earnings with whoever shared the task with me.
952,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based on merit participant X earned nothing so they deserve nothing extra  Desire to punish participant X for under performance
953,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe in fairness and equality.
955,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered so many questions too, in that they missed only one answer to be equal to participant Y. Therefore the should be rewarded for their effort to motivate them."
956,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to redistribute the earnings because it would only be fare that participant X earned at least some portion because the completed some tasks though not as many as participant Y
958,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didnt think it would be fair to take compensation away from the participant who completed more questions.
959,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think the initial distribution is fair, but it's what was agreed on, and I think it would be less fair to change it after the work was done."
962,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute because Participant Y earned their reward fairly by solving more problems, the rules were clear beforehand, and keeping the original payout preserves fairness and motivation."
965,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not believe in taking earned wages from one person and giving to someone else that did not meet the requirements themselves
966,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants voluntarily elected to go with the decision to have a merit-based compensation system. It'd only be fair for the high performer to be rewarded with more money, as stipulated in the original terms."
970,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe participant x was equally good and the difference was close and that, he or she deserves some bonus as well"
971,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Let he other person earn his/her own bonus; etc.
972,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I dont think the other person needs anymore money
973,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to treat it the way a tournament would be run. I decided the stakes should be take all. Since Participant Y solved more problems he wins the prize.
974,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to redistribute 50% of participant Y's earnings to participant X was motivated by a desire to balance fairness and performance-based reward.I recognized that the competitive structure of the task led to a significant disparity in earnings, and I wanted to acknowledge the effort of both participants while not entirely negating the performance difference."
975,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y performed well and deserves the larger share, but participant X also solve a high number of problems, showing strong effort."
976,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because of minimal perfomance gap
978,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was stated in the instructions that the participants had to answer question equal to the other in order to recieve pay as they did not they should not be payed.
979,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought x deserved at least something for solving several problems.
980,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since the totals are almost equal, I don't think that the distribution of incentive should be solely for only the one person."
981,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He still did some tasks, so they deserve some share."
982,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute part of the earnings to promote fairness and acknowledge Participant Xs effort, even though they scored lower."
983,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I  wanted to praise Participant Y beyond the acceptance of performance of X considering that X had also done something. Distribution of a small amount encourages equity without trashing merit.
984,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think X should get something, but as they did get more wrong, I thought that 50 cents was a fair amount."
985,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He has worked and deserves something although not as much as the other person Y
987,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That was the original pay scale that they were informed of and agreed to.
988,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person that done the most work should get the reward.
990,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well they knew when it started that if they scored lower they would get 0.00.  I felt it to be okay to give them a little something but to not take away too much from participant Y.
992,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give Participant X a portion of Ys earnings to recognize effort, even if performance was lower. Everyone contributed time, and partial sharing feels fairer than complete exclusion."
994,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give a portion of Ys earnings to X because X still solved many problems. Rewarding effort encourages fairness, even if Y performed better overall. Both deserve recognition."
995,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted X to get something, but Y should be acknowledged for its efforts. I wanted Y to get more than X, but that X should get something, too."
997,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believed they should keep most of the money because they got more questions right
998,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since participant X actually solved some questions, it would be unfair if participant X went home empty handed."
999,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The amount to be received.
1001,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This will recognize the effort of X and will not disregard the superior performance of Y. It's much fair to both of them.
1003,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did solve 12 problems and therefore they should deserve some sort of earnings. I decided to give them 1/3rd of the earnings. It would not be enjoyable to solve 12 problems and not get anything just because the other participant solved 4 more than you.
1004,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The answer is 0 because the rules said only the person who solved at least as many problems as the other would earn money. Since Y solved more than X, Y earned the money fairly. Changing that would go against the rules both agreed to."
1006,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought based on the rules that the disbursement was pretty fair for the effort.
1007,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to distribute according to merit in the sense that participant X received a good amount of right answers and hence deserved some of the compensation amount, but Y got more answers correct, so I still left them with the highest compensation."
1009,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is because y to x was primary brought by desire
1010,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That is the fair choice since participant X wronged one question and participant Y got all the questions correct meaning that he deserved to get a bigger share an d it would have been unfair not to give participant X nothing at all.
1012,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant X got 12 answers right versus 15 for the other participant, so it would only be fair to award them some form of compensation"
1014,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clear that the one with the most correct answers earned the income.  There should be no changes at the late stage.
1015,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate x didnt perform the task as well as participate y, participant y did the best. Participant y  deserves to keep the money he or she earned because they did a better job."
1017,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision is based on fairness. I chose not to give any money to participant X because participant Y solved more problems and earned it. Both people knew the rules. It is fair to let the person who did better keep their money.
1018,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did better than X, and they both knew the rules before starting  only the better one gets paid. Changing that now wouldnt be fair to Y, who earned it fair and square."
1023,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both got majority of the questions right with only a slight disperity and the effort of person X are as much of value as person Y
1024,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If this was a real job it would be unethical to pay someone who was a little less competent at their job zero dollars
1025,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more problems compared to person X, how ever person X also solved some problems and I feel that they need a compensation. But since participant X solved less problems, then they deserve a less compared to participant Y."
1026,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There were clear instructions before the game. So there is no need to edit what the participants will get.
1027,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were told the rules and rewards before beginning the task.
1029,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to transfer $0.50 to Participant X and let Participant Y keep $1.75. My reasoning is that while Y clearly performed better and deserves most of the reward, X wasnt too far behind. Their effort still counts. I think its fair to recognize hard work even if the results were slightly lower. This way, Y is rewarded for doing well, and X isnt left empty-handed. It feels like a reasonable middle ground between fairness and encouraging effort."
1031,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not fair to take money from someone and give it to someone else. Both workers knew there was a change the may get nothing.
1032,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though the second participant didn't get as much as the first, they still contributed"
1034,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Acknowledging participant X's effort.
1035,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  giving a dollar to participant x feels fair to me
1036,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants played the game as described to them and I don't want to suddenly change the rules.  I feel it would be just as unfair to suddenly change payouts, even if they are unequal."
1037,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered 16 questions correctly, and Participant Y answered 18 correctly a difference of just 2. I gave X 1 USD and gave the rest to Y because I thought this was a fair way to split the reward."
1041,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more and won fair and square. They do not have to share money with someone else who did not earn it.
1042,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For me I decided to not redistribute the earnings because participant Y solved more problems than participant X. According to me payments depends on your performance it will not be fair to split earnings against a person who performed poorly.
1043,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because X only got 4 right and Y got 22. I believe it is fair that Y receives his full amount, since he got most of it correct, while X only got 4 correct. It doesn't seem fair that Y has to give his earnings to X."
1044,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Redistribution would not just for me as everyperson knew the rules and terms tothe leding payments
1045,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The motivation behind my decision was that the payment structure was determined and communicated in advance. Rewards were determined according to performance and outperforming one's partner. Y put in a great effort and was rewarded for their best performance. Shifting part of Y earnings to X would be unfair and failure to stick to the rules.
1047,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They didnt deserve it
1048,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well, I figured it's right to share and not just give all the reward to participant Y. as participant X also tried, the sharing formula will definitely be different and Y will get higher reward but i believe X should also still be rewarded."
1049,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X was 2 problems short on what Participant Y solve which involved some effort. Fraction earning goes to acknowledge that effort.
1055,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was motivated to distribute 0.85 to participant X because he did well by getting only two wrong questions
1056,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just randomly chose .50. There really was no rhyme or reason behind it.
1057,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the person that solved most of the problems should receive the highest amount
1058,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems fair to distribute the money equally. They each worked on the set of problems, so they should both be compensated the same."
1060,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The decision balances the recognition of participants X's contribution with the preservations of participants Y's earned reward with an aim of justifiable outcome.
1066,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 from participant Y to participant X to balance fairness and merit. While participant Y clearly performed better and deserves the majority of the reward, participant X still contributed effort and time. The small redistribution acknowledges Xs participation without undermining the performance-based structure of the task. This decision reflects both a respect for results and a sense of compassion."
1067,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  BECAUSE HE PARTICIPATED IN DOING SLIGHTLY LESS QUESTIONS THAN y
1068,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt the lower score deserved something for their effort but the higher score deserved more money.
1069,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My goal is always to ensure the information I provide is easy to understand  I aim to deliver information quickly and effectively
1074,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did solve quite a number of patterns which is 13 . On the other hand participant Y solved 21. It would be unfair to participant X to receive nothing and yet he solved 13 patterns. Yes, the pay out cannot be the same as participant Y but the $1 seems like an appropriate reward for the effort participant X had given."
1076,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to redistribute the money to give both participants similar amounts, but give slightly more to the person who performed better."
1077,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one participant worked hard and got a lot right. That earning shouldn't be shared with someone that didn't work as hard.
1079,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants had almost a tie in the correct answers and each should have been rewarded accordingly.
1080,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Why take from someone who answered their questions to share with someone who didn't, was my thinking"
1081,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X also answered some questions correctly and since he/she was paired with Y he/she also deserves a share of Y's Earnings
1082,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Performance-based reward is fair; Y earned more through better results.
1084,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This decision balances the incentive structure of the task with a sense of fairness, recognizing that participant X still contributed effort, even if they didn't meet the payment criteria."
1085,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants X and Y solved some problems. However, participant Y solved 14 problems and person X solved only 5 problems. They both deserve a compensation though participant Y deserves more compensation for their effort."
1086,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  small token for taking time to participate
1087,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The player earned their money fair and square.
1088,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that participant X also deserved to earn as they also completed the task despite the punitive guidelines, thus I decided to share participant Y's earnings to ensure the other also got something even if not equally shared."
1090,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The player who scored 4 did poorly compared to the player who scored 18
1091,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should still get something for their efforts, but Y still retains a significant majority of the rewards."
1092,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The range between participant Y and participant X is not that big and so I believe it is fair to award participant X something small for the attempt.
1093,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seemed as fair as possible, with the one who actually won benefitting by .01."
1094,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  solved some problems
1097,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't think it was fair that the participant who solved just 2 less than the winner would receive nothing for their time and efforts. I didn't want to take away too much of the winner's earnings, but I did want to acknowedge the effort of the other payer."
1098,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To appreciate his/her work. At least  he/she contributed in solving the problems.
1099,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were stated a certain way in the beginning.  It doesn't make sense to penalize the person who answered more questions by taking from their earnings.
1100,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  although participant x did not beat the other participant, he or she came really close and i think rewarding the effort is only natural. i would offer participant x $0.7 and participant y $2."
1101,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to transfer $2,54 from Y to X to recognize X's strong effort (18 problems solved) while still rewarding Y's exceptional performance (23 problems solved). This balanced approach maintains fairness and preserves incentives for high achievement"
1102,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x did answer some correctly so i thought they should get some bonus
1103,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to compensate both participants but proportional to their performance.
1104,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This split is simple, enforceable, and avoids extreme outcomes (e.g., leaving X with nothing or overly penalizing Y)."
1105,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x didn't earn y's money.
1106,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  IT WAS BECAUSE X DID NOT FAIL . HE INVESTED IN ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS AND DID IT CORRECTLY
1107,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I took into account both participants' performance and effort. According to the task regulations, Participant Y got the original payout equitably after solving additional tasks. But by completing 13 challenges, Participant X also showed a great deal of effort, which is noteworthy in comparison to the distribution as a whole. My choice to redistribute strikes a compromise between praising the effort of the individual who performed worse and rewarding better performance."
1108,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that doing 14 problems deserves some type of reward, maybe not as large as the second person's reward."
1109,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered 9 questions, just two shy of Participant  Y.  X should be compensated for their time and effort.  There are many factors that could have effected the outcome between the two participants making the outcome less fair in determining who answered more, therefore, X deserves something."
1110,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I only believe its fair they have some almost equal share. SO X can get a little cash of the whole sum.
1112,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  fair distribution
1113,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants agreed to the terms before playing so there is no reason to change the rules afterwards
1114,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X showed great effort to answer the questions too so giving him or her zero while Y is getting the whole amount is unfair-there was only one difference in answering the question hence need for fair treatment.
1115,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel the distribution is fair because the participant at least undertook the task.
1119,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute because both participants agreed to the rules upfront. Y clearly outperformed X, and rewarding based on that performance feels fair. Changing the payout after the fact would undermine the original incentive and effort structure."
1124,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Highest reward goes to the highest performer. I feel the participant should take home what is due to them
1125,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by fairness and adherence to the rules set at the beginning of the task. Both participants were informed that only the one who solved as many or more problems than their counterpart would earn money. Participant Y solved significantly more problems than Participant X and therefore earned the reward. Redistributing the earnings would undermine the incentive structure and fairness of the competition.
1126,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believed that participant X deserved some payment, but because participant Y answered more, their payout should still be higher."
1129,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  At least participant X solved some problems. If he or she could have not solved any then he or she could receive 0.
1131,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought the second person deserved something for their effort, but wanted to ensure I rewarded the winner appropriately."
1133,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It promotes fairness.
1134,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seemed to me that since they both worked, they should share in the reward"
1135,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the participants were clearly told the rules and outcomes of the game I see no reason to deviate from that.
1136,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X didn't even score up to half of what participant Y scored and shouldn't get any rewards.
1137,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who solved fewer problems should still be compensated for their efforts.
1138,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Paticipant X solved 12 problems which is a substantial figure and near 15 problems of paricipant y. It is fair that yhey be compensated some small amount of money for motivation
1139,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x took part in the work so compensating them would be good
1140,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were fully specified prior, thus I decided not to disburse as participant Y received their prize via excellent performance."
1142,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt sorry for the person who got fewer right. The fact that this person got 7 right showed that they did try, but they got just over 1/3 of the score that the other person did. This might be due to lack of mathematical training or poor math skills rather than low effort."
1143,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did not answer that many more questions than participant X, so I thought it was fair to give participant X some of the winnings."
1144,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules are made clear to the participants beforehand so they know that if they didn't answer as many questions as the other person that they got zero. Sorry for the sake of this study the rules need to be followed and maintained.
1145,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I  choose the last option because i felt hat both participants used effort and time to solve the problems. I also felt that it was only that the out come was different but the effort was the same also the difference was not that big and also the other participant had a right to be appreciated for making the effort to participate.
1146,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y deserved his earnings since he won the game and the earnings are too small to redristribute.
1147,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is better to award him or her with a little token for the good work and willingness to solve the problem.
1148,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be fair and make sure both Y and X got the same amount.
1149,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt lime it woukd be more fair for each since participant y only solved one more problem than x and there is no much difference
1152,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured Participant X also answered 6 problems correctly, that would account for something so am giving 50cents as an incentive."
1153,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i was looking at the fairness
1154,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I split $0.75 to X to balance fairness (rewarding X's effort) with merit (preserving Y's advantage for better performance). This keeps incentives intact while reducing disparity.
1157,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both participants took equal time and (assuming no distractions) equal effort at answering as many questions as possible. I chose to take the difference in share of participants between the two and multiply that against the earning to arrive at the redistribution amount.
1159,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 to participant X to acknowledge their effort while still rewarding Y for their higher performance. This small redistribution balances fairness and compassion without fully undermining the merit-based system the participants agreed to. It encourages effort while maintaining incentive for strong performance.
1160,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were set from the very beginning. Regardless of the distribution graph, it would be unfair to punish the participant who got 24 answers correct, after the rules were already laid out."
1161,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants took part in the task. Equal sharing reflects a strong belief in equality regardless of performance outcomes
1162,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X answered 1/4 of the questions so I gave them 1/4 of the payment
1164,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give 1 to participant x because their performance was very close to participant Y and well above average warranting partial compensation for their strong effort.
1165,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person that did more work deserves the pay for the work and effort.  Choosing to do less, even if it's competitive, is grounds for receiving less."
1169,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant X made an effort hence should at least receive a stipend or a reward for that effort
1171,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of the game were clear;  the participants knew that they could try their best and still earn nothing.  It isn't fair to reduce the earnings promised to one participant who correctly solved more problems than the other.  It would be a violation of the rules either way.
1175,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was trying to be fair based on contribution, as participant X solved less problems"
1176,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since x participated its fair to give him/her a reward.
1177,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I guess I feel like everyone deserves to be rewarded for what they did do right, as opposed to receiving nothing, unless they truly did nothing and earned it."
1178,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like Y answered more correct questions so he or she deserved more money.
1179,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It would be unfair for one to get paid for their work and the other not to get paid.
1180,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel they should receive something for trying
1181,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didnt redistribute because both knew the rules going in. Y earned their money fairly, and it wouldnt feel right to take that away after the fact."
1185,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants agreed to the rules beforehand, which clearly stated that only the higher performing participant would earn money. Participant Y performed better and earned the reward fairly. Changing the payout afterward would undermine the original agreement and reduce the incentive to perform well."
1186,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While Participant Y earned the reward, I felt it was fair to share a small portion with Participant X to acknowledge their effort and reduce the harshness of earning nothing. This strikes a balance between merit and compassion."
1188,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also participated and to be fair he should be awarded
1190,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In as much as participant Y solved more problems, participant X also tried so she deserve to be awarded too"
1191,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Despite scoring less than X, Y also put in effort in solving  the problems, and thus,it is only fair to reward them"
1192,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   the earnings... the winner won and that's that.
1194,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more problems and earned their reward accordingly
1195,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I basically felt that participant X got a high volume of answers right. So I essentially calculated the # of answers he got right vs Participant Y (14-11=3), multiplied that by .15 and gave him roughly half of that.  I chose 3 instead of 11 as that was a lower number.  He ultimately still got less right."
1196,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was based on fairness and adherence to the rules that both participants agreed to before the task. Participant Y earned their payout by performing significantly better than participant X, and there was no indication of unfairness or external factors affecting the results. Redistributing Ys earnings would undermine the merit-based structure of the task and reduce the incentive for strong performance. Therefore, I believe it is most just to leave the earnings as they are."
1198,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Each person should be paid based on their performance. The higher the performance the higher the pay
1199,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y won because of winning more decisions than X. However, the distribution was necessary to acknowledge the efforts of X while still rewarding Y's greater performance. The 0.64 was a favorable allocation for X above average performance."
1200,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by the principle of fairness and respect for agreed-upon rules. Both participants entered the task knowing the conditions: the higher scorer earns money; the lower scorer earns nothing. Participant Y performed better and earned their reward. Redistributing earnings after the fact would undermine the fairness of the system and could discourage effort or trust in future similar tasks. While I recognize that both participants made an effort, honoring the original rules maintains the integrity of the competition."
1201,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They knew from the beginning that is was a possibility they may not receive anything according to how many questions were answered correctly.
1202,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Equality and social fairness: X only solved one less problem and got nothing.
1203,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the other person did do the work and should get something
1205,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I distributed it that way because there was a small margin between the solved problems of both participants.
1206,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants knew the rules of the game.
1208,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to give any of Ys earnings to X because the rules were clearly explained and agreed to before the task began. Y earned the money by performing better, which was part of the deal. Taking away part of Ys earnings afterward wouldnt be fair or respectful of the original agreement."
1210,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just split the total of Y's earnings with X. So therefore they will both receive the same amount.
1212,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For fairness, I gave Participant X $1.00 because I appreciated their effort. This ensures that both feel their efforts were recognized despite different results, while also honoring Participant Y's larger income and advancing equity."
1214,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is due to the prior agreement ,that fairness principle would be in place."
1215,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I aimed to balance acknowledging Participant X's effort for the problems solved with respecting Participant Y's superior performance as per the study's rules.
1218,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  all participants needs to be appreciated even if its by a small percentage
1219,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because he solved 1 less than participant Y hence equal distribution seemed a bit fair
1222,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved only 3 more problems than participant X
1223,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to make them have equal amount
1224,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it was a nice even number, although it was odd."
1227,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the other participant deserves a little something for their work, even though they didn't outperform. I didn't want to take away too much from the winner's earnings as this goes against what they were told about payments."
1228,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  So far as they are partners the reward should be shared, if one is not selfless enough he can just give any amount he wants to give."
1230,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main motivation is to acknowledge the efforts made by the other participant. It feels like a fair decision.
1231,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute earnings because the rules clearly stated that only the participant who solved more problems would be rewarded. Participant Y earned the $3.00 fairly by significantly outperforming Participant X. Changing the distribution would undermine the merit-based system and the incentive structure communicated before the task.
1232,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that overall Y did better than X so they should be rewarded as such.  However I think X should still be given something for their efforts.  They weren't that far off Y, so to me, I think they can have a small portion.  Just the leftover change."
1233,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.50 to Participant X because they performed almost as well as Participant Y, solving just two fewer problems. While Y earned more through better performance and should keep the majority of the reward, I believe Xs effort deserves some recognition. This small redistribution balances fairness and merit."
1234,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants contributed to the success of the study/competition so each had a right to benefit.
1235,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  nothing really. I just decided on that
1236,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think X has made decision that are vary from Y, yet we can give based on the decisions he took"
1237,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not fair for one participant to earn the full $3.15 while the other participant earns nothing.
1238,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told from the beginning that they would only be paid if they answered the same or more questions then the participant they were paired with.
1240,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned the compensation fairly.
1241,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it was only fair that they get a dollar since they solved almost half of problems.
1242,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did almost half as many questions as Y, so I feel they deserve at least a little bit."
1243,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not get paid anything so why should they
1244,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both participants agreed to the rule that the high perfomer earns more money , however Y solved more problems by which he deserved to earn the amount. Also we have to recognize X effort by rewarding him with something without undermining Y ."
1245,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just allocated the money based on the percentage the participant got right of the total number of correct answers.
1246,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not feel like it was fair to take money from participant y to give to participant x when participant y solved almost 3x as many problems. I feel like participant x may not have tried as hard and should not be awarded for that.
1247,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant Y should get more since they performed better, but I didn't want participant X to come out feeling bad because they got nothing, or their reward was negligible enough to feel like they wasted their time. So I gave an unscientific vibes-based number that feels like fits both of those."
1248,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved one more problem than X. I had to be fair in the decision, as all put effort into the task."
1249,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There is no way to know how the matching of the individuals was done, so to ensure some amount of compensation to both I thought $1 was fair. It could be that one of the individuals was an expert in whatever the task was and the other was not familiar."
1250,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  As a christian it is advised to share what you have no matter how small it is.
1251,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was motivated by the fact that participant Y did excellently well than participant X which earned him the amount but also, considering bein fair towards participant X to encourage him."
1252,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  maybe I failed to understand you fully but if one is getting 15 cents for each questin answered correctly, then participant x deserved to get sth agter answering 20 correct questions. Thats why I sacrificed 1 dollar.,"
1253,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both played by the rules so it does not make sense to penalize the winner in this case.
1254,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant will at least get something for the sake of participating.
1255,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant can get something but he did not answer as many questions. I gave him a little while giving the other person an even number of 3 and no change.
1256,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not redistribute the profit because Participant Y won the reward according to a clear, well-discussed rule. Keeping with the initial terms is an act of justice and integrity in the activity."
1257,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X knew what the terms of participation were and what the risk was of earning nothing. I find it acceptible not to redistribute money. I also don't want to hurt Participant Y by decreasing Y's earnings when I redistribute.
1258,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  since participant X only solved 1 less problem than participant Y it doesnt seem fair that they would get 0.  they should get a smaller bonus for their effort
1259,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that leaving one participant with no bonus is unfair considering that the person was beaten by one only.
1260,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Sharing the bonus is also as an act of being generous and kind towards human race
1261,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i think that it is good to give something since they both got some questions right just one person attempted more questions than the other
1262,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  First of all, just to make things a little even money wise. 3.00 looks better than 3.15. Secondly, while that participant solved less correctly, they still solved like 14, so why not give them a free .15 for that."
1263,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They tried hard and got many answers right, so it seems fair to give them something while still letting participant Y keep most of the money."
1264,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that the other participant should get some pay because they actually did some work. This is more fair.
1265,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The difference between participant's X and Y's points is just 2. It would be unfair for one participant to get zero while they put in the effort too. So that's why I deducted a small proportion to be given to Y, almost a representative of the difference in points"
1266,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This would make things even for both groups
1267,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y did most of the work, so Person Y deserves more of the reward."
1269,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think every participant should get something.
1270,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would give 1.00 to participant X to recognize their significantly greater effort and performance compared to participant Y.
1271,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give x 0.75 cents based on a balance between fairness and maximizing efficiency. My goal was to ensure that x received enough to feel their contribution was valued, while also preserving enough resources for others who might bring higher value or lower costs."
1272,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I calculated roughly what each answer was worth if the 1.35 earned by Y was distributed across the 17 correct answers, and gave X about what 8 correct answers was worth."
1274,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant still did work, and probably spent effort, they just didn't accomplish as much work. But I believe in equality, and redistribution of wealth."
1275,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The median number of solved problems played a big role
1276,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is just the right and fair amoung
1277,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x answered half of the answers correctther that participant y did so I feel as thought they shoudl get something for their correct answers and time
1278,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Redistributing it would give the loser the impression that this sort of thing would happen again.  They might rely on it happening again in the future, or even feel entitled to it.  Also, redistributing it would have demotivated the winner so they wouldn't have tried as hard in the future and would have looked for other people to do well around."
1279,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did complete 4 problems and should receive a small amount.
1280,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by the fact that X had completed at least 10 questions correctly, which is more than half of what Y had completed. Awarding the X 0.9 USD is a means to appreciate the effort put towards responding to the questions, but also understanding that there had been a disclaimer in place that the one who got the most amount had to complete the most questions correctly, and X did not meet that criterion."
1281,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did extremely poor, making no room for payment and redistribution"
1282,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that since the difference between the number of solved problems was only 3, the other participant should be given a little something for their efforts."
1283,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  since all participants took part and wasted their  time,y deserves something"
1284,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned that higher share because he worked harder as shown by the result but allowing participant X to go empty handed seems harsh and abit unfair
1285,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants should be paid equally, they both did the same work so they both should receive the same pay"
1288,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other person did some work so I wanted them to have a token payment even though it wasnt much, as I wanted the one who did the best to get most of the reward."
1289,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Each participant had a chance to complete and my choice was based on a fair way for each.
1290,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that participant also tried to the best of his knowledge
1291,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give them something for trying.
1292,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe participant X still provided value in answering questions, so they should receive close to half of the reward"
1293,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not think that X contributed enough to receive half of the earnings but they tried which is important.
1294,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y outperformed X by solving two times more problems. I wanted to balance fairness and incentives.
1295,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  y did better so he should get paid
1296,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules were already preset so i see no reason to change them.
1297,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved almost as many problems as Participant Y, so I believe they should be rewarded with some funds.  This is what the rules of the game state, but since the two's performance is similar I do not believe there should be a 0 reward for either."
1298,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In order to thank Participant Y for their better performance and to recognize their effort, I decided to redistribute $0.85 to Participant X. This method strikes a balance between merit and fairness; Y still gets the majority of their deserved reward, but X doesn't go home empty-handed. It expresses a partial equity viewpoint without totally discrediting performance-based rewards."
1299,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe a small amount can be given just as a sign of participation. The majority of the funds (80%) would go to the winner.
1300,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe in rewarding effort to some extent, even if the participant didn't win under the original rules. At the same time, I wanted to ensure that Ys superior performance was recognized, so I only redistributed a small portion."
1301,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should earn at least something for participating, but not more than participant Y"
1302,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  its not right that person x completed problems and did not get paid.  therefore i would try to split equally
1303,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to redistribute $0.50 to reward Participant X with doing the effort to solve 11 problems and be rewarded with at least some compensation even though he or she made zero dollars at the beginning. Such partial transfer is a compromise of fairness and merit because Participant Y has been left with most of their earnings ($2.20) due to their greater productivity. The level is compromise-balancing-it provides incentive to work and at the same time does not undermine the motivation to work hard on another task in the future.
1304,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based the scores
1305,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that both parties took the time to attempt to solve the problems and as a result they should both earn something.
1306,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to maintain transparency and fairness basing on the rules in the description
1307,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person did get 10 complete so I thought they deserved some compensation although I did not want to take too much away from the person who got 23 answers correct.
1308,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason for my decision is wanting other participants to potentially receive something out of the study.
1309,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like each participant should get something since they both solved a number of problems.
1310,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that they did similarly in their skills; therefore, they deserve to split the earnings."
1311,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to completely redistribute the earnings to the Participant X because I believe in equality and that no one should leave without any reward of efforts even though it was lower. Consideration of the entire sum is indeed humane and goes along the way of lessening the disparity among people, particularly when the competitive environment leads to one individual having nothing."
1312,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted participant X to get something for the task they completed no matter how small it was. I didn't want the amount I deduct to also affect Y sustantially.
1313,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Honestly I'm not good at math problems so I decided on a share that I think wouldn't hurt me in the longrun
1314,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told upfront how earnings would be determined and paid out.  They did not have to participate.  Everything was clear and fair.
1315,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y only solved 1 more than x
1316,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of the game were clearly explained in the beginning. I saw no reason to violate the rules and redistribute the money to the losing participant.
1317,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also tried and completed what they could, so I think a token payment is not untoward; Participant Y will still get a payment that reflects their superior performance - just without leaving the other player with absolutely nothing."
1319,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by the participation of person X.
1320,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Ys result is exceptional, while Xs is below the median. Y solved twice as many problems as X. The rules were clear beforehand, and no deception or unfair advantage was involved. And, I believe rewards should match effort and results, hence Y should retain the full $3.00 based on merit and rules. I would choose to redistribute $0.00."
1321,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the money should be split fairly evenly because it was a team effort.
1322,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel it's fair! With 16 and 18 correct answers, I think it's justified to share the distribution with he who solved 16 correctly!"
1323,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it would be more fair to pay the participants based on how many correct answers they got rather than who won.
1324,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X had almost a similar number to Y and therefore I felt that t was fair to share the amount in that manner...
1325,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did a good job and should be rewarded for it. His number was near the top.
1326,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y answered more questions as per the outline instructions for payment
1327,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i feel its just right that way
1329,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X may have worked just as hard as participant Y on the project but ,maybe they didn't understand the questions as well. i feel they should still get something for their effort."
1330,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y outperform participant X in terms of performance.
1331,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because it is fair considering they did almost an equal amount of correct work
1332,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $1.00 to participant X because they demonstrated substantial effort by solving more than half of the problems. While participant Y outperformed and deserves to keep the majority of the earnings, I believe a modest redistribution recognizes Xs contribution without undermining the performance-based incentive. This strikes a balance between fairness and merit."
1333,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since it was obvious from the start that only the participant with the best performance would receive money, I decided not to disperse any of participant Y's profits.  By solving more problems, Participant Y received the award in a fair manner; altering that after the fact would be unjust and deter effort."
1334,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not want the other participant to remain with 0.0 that is why i decided to give one to the other one
1335,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did better and should therefore benefit more than X
1336,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  he did solve all the problems
1337,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X was very close answering the same amount of questions as Participant Y
1338,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person solved less problems than the other party and that is the payment
1339,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both players agreed to rules prior to playing.  It would be unfair to take some of Player Y's money to give to Player X. If there were additional funds I could give to Player X, I would but I would not take them from player Y."
1340,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was only a 2 question difference, meaning both put in close to the same amount of work"
1341,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both people did similar amounts of work, so I chose to redistribute based on equity and fairness."
1342,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i think that the they both have the same amount of things
1343,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because some people have a harder time with certain types of tests and the reasoning is fair.
1344,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The amounts were similar so to me Y deserved what he has and doesn't need to share.
1345,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Its just seems so unfair. They only answered four additional questions correctly. Why should the others get paid nothing? Its more fair to split the earnings.
1346,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since participant x got nothing after getting 9 correct answers, my decision to give them/0.25 is a way of motivating player x"
1347,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reward must reflect a merit otherwise it incentivizes mediocrity
1348,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the rules at the beginning were clear, I dont think there is need to change anything at all its fair."
1349,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that they both should receive the same or closely the same pay because they did the same amount .
1350,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned their money through a greater level of correct answers
1351,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions clearly stated that if they did not get at least the same amount right they would get nothing
1352,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am trying to be fair
1353,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not want to give the other person any allocation.
1354,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not fair for one participant to get nothing while they still completed quite a bit of work.
1355,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  if you gave half of y's earnings to x
1356,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   To consider the efforts of both contestants. It feels fair to balance the outcome more closely and reward sides for time spent, rather than an all-or-nothing outcome."
1357,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I based my decision on what I view as fair and what I consider an ideal way to recognize specific participants.
1358,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  y should keep what they earned
1360,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that the rules were clearly stated and I chose to follow them. I see no reason to deviate.
1361,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that everyone worked hard for the questions but a winner is a winner and must receive better compensations for it.
1362,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like the participants knew what they signed up for and the amount is relatively small enough that I don't feel redistribution is really needed. If the amounts were 10x it may feel slightly more fair for the time and effort.
1363,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to allocate some of the earnings of participant Y to participant X since he solved fewer problems, and it would be fair to redistribute some in this instance."
1364,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I personally would feel bad if I spend time taking a study and didnt get paid simply due to my partner performing better. As least some compensation for time is in order.
1365,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the participant get the score of 11 which is a trial.
1366,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i felt like they should be rewarded something
1367,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought the fairest distribution was to divide the reward equally between the two participants.
1368,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant got some correct but not as many as y do I have them some.
1369,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  After my calculations, Participant Y was fairly compensated for finishing more problems than Participant X, and the amount is equal to the effort they put in. For X, they knew about the risk and attempted, but unfortunately, they could not beat Y."
1370,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reasons that motivated my decision are:    Fairness to the agreed rules: Both participants were informed in advance that only the higher or equally performing participant would be paid. Changing the payout afterward would violate that agreement.    Merit-based reward: Participant Y solved more problems and earned the reward through better performance. Its fair that they keep what they earned.    Integrity of the system: Upholding the rules ensures trust in the process and maintains the incentive structure for future studies. Redistributing would set a precedent that effort, not outcome, determines rewardscontradicting the original terms."
1371,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were close enough that both participants should get something but Y should still get more because first is best and should be compensated accordingly
1372,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided they should share based on the same rate per problem solved. So I gave 13/30 of Y's earning to X.
1374,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person y performed better than x, but without x solving 5, y would get nothing."
1375,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe both participant made equal effort but should be rewarded in a ratio on how they scored on basis of equitability
1376,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x solved 5 correct and should get some money but not much of Y's
1377,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered 10, the person contributed."
1378,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the participant just received a token of appreciation but did very little task
1379,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant X  solved three problems
1380,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To acknowledge the performance of Y whilst ensuring X doesn't walk away entirely empty.
1381,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i decided to give 0.85 of participant y earnings because participant x has no earning
1382,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I'd like to give the other participant something but not all of my earnings.
1383,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was explained to X that if they didn't match Y's answer rate, they wouldn't be paid any money.  As a responsible adult, they know the consequences of their actions.  They also consented to the outcome when they chose to participate in the study which may involved not getting paid for their time and effort."
1384,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they both should get a bonus but Y did better so they should get more.
1385,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The art of sharing with others without just thinking about yourself
1386,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y completed all the questions, while Participant X struggled to do half; it wouldn't be right to split their earnings."
1387,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I considered fairness in performance-based rewards against compassion or redistribution values in my decision
1388,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  15 is a pretty high number, 19 is exceptional"
1389,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant Y worked harder by answering more problems.
1390,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Normally I wanted to give Participant X nothing but I wanted them to at least feel a little bit appreciated for the effort they put in and therefore decided to remove the extra 15 cents for them
1391,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just give the 0.4 to this participant for just a participation purposes so that they should not go home empty handed.
1392,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the person who only got one less should still receive a fair bonus. Some people are just better at solving these types of problems, but both put forth the effort. By giving $1, they receive a fair bonus, and the other person who performed better got an additional 10 cents. I think this is as fair of a split as possible, given that one person did a little better, but only one more than the other."
1393,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to strike a compromise between fairness and performance-based merit, which is why I decided to transfer $0.90 from Participant Y to Participant X:"
1394,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems like a fair amount for both.
1396,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered the most correct
1397,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that everyone should be rewarded what they truly deserve, competitively."
1398,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that participant X should still receive a little, even though Y got slightly more answers correct. However, I do not feel that it should be a significant amount and only a portion of Y's earnings."
1399,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They almost had exact numbers correct the second person was only four off so I gave them almost half the money but not quite.
1400,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it was fair that the person who did the work should get paid more.
1401,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was a fair competition and both participants knew the rules.
1402,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants are meritorious:  both clearly outperformed the population average.    The default distribution is to follow the expressed rules:  winner-takes-all.  _However_, my reading of the facts presented is that the difference in their performances is considerably smaller than the amount by which they both exceeded the population average.  I therefore consider that the most equitable outcome is to recognize the modest-but-more-than-zero likelihood that the testing instrument itself is in error, and shift a portion of the payout from the winner to the almost-winner."
1403,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I intended to encourage merit-based reward intertwined with feelings of fairness and human compassion, which is why I made such a choice. The participant Y undistinguishably deserved his/her payout due to the increased number of solved problems, and the majority of the reward should belong to him/her. Nevertheless, Participant X did his or her best and thus managed to solve 8 problems, which has to be noticed. I would compensate X with a small amount of earnings of Y in an attempt to match their effort without cutting the incentive scheme so much that performance is no longer an issue."
1405,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Losers dont get to feel like winners. They get to taste loss that they may be motivated to win next time or die in the eventually shame of endless defeats.
1406,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's a fairly even distribution that reflects how many solutions each participant completed. It also doesn't exclude the person who didn't perform as well.
1407,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My choice was mostly driven by the necessity of following the experiment's guidelines and being equitable to Participant Y, who was paid in accordance with the specified competitive standards."
1408,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved way more problems (18 vs. 8), and the rules were clear from the start get at least as many as the other person to earn money. It was a fair setup, and Y earned their payout. X knew the deal going in, so changing it after feels unfair to Y who worked harder or performed better."
1409,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They solved more problems, so they won the money. I dont think that I have the right to give it away."
1410,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The amount of one's X got right credited for in ratio to the ones Y got right.
1411,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just split it down the middle because it seemed fair
1412,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y is not in any way obligated to give participant X anything but then participant X put in a lot of effort and it wouldn't seem fair if they got paid nothing
1413,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The results were close.
1414,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Me not getting involved is the fairest. You get what you deserve according to the rules
1415,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the reasone i choose that  is because one really worked hard to earn the money
1416,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did get 14 correct, so I believed there should be some compensation for their time."
1417,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If I distribute 0, will receive zero and I will get 2.85"
1418,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For motivational purposes sincerely
1419,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He should get a lesser amount for answering less questions correctly but I tried to give him an amount where he still made something for each answer correct
1420,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to be fair
1421,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants knew the rules of the game.  One person would either tie or lose, the other person would either tie or win.  The person who won deserves the money."
1422,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To encourage participant X work harder
1423,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute because participant Y earned the payment based on clearly stated rules and better performance.
1424,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just nice to give them something
1425,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well participant Y earned the money by answering more questions. But participant X did put an effort in.
1427,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they answered nearly the same amount
1428,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to honor the rules that were explained to the participants.
1429,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though Y solved more prolems, X did solve a good amount too, so they should be compensated."
1430,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate X only got 3 more questions correct than participate Y.  Y deserves something for getting 18 correct answers.
1431,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe Y deserved to get all the earnings. This way, one would get enough money which they have earned and they deserve"
1432,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This isn't enough contextual information to know if redistribution makes any sense. Thus I default to merit based, and Y solved more. Clearly outlined at the beginning."
1434,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I have done the calculations, and find out that the person y is more to person x in half, so i decided to give person x a quarter of the earnings"
1435,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason that motived my decision to offer X 0.75 was to create fairness and also, Y deserves more than X because Y outperformed, whiles X also did a significant effort."
1436,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did almost the same! If I get to make a choice, I think they should share it for doing almost equally, especially when others did much worse."
1437,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of the game were clear. Y significantly outperformed X and earned the bonus.  X should not be given anything for losing.
1438,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y is the winner and the prize belong to him. Participant X lost to participant Y and deserves no reward especially when the reward will affect participant Y's reward.
1439,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  A little token to motivate participant X. Solving 10 questions out of 15 commendable, and a little bonus for effort won't hurt."
1440,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The amount will benefit Y and also not affect X too much.
1441,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't think it was right that participant X got no bonus. They were fairly close to the average (within the normal range) and their performance was close to participant y's. As far as the totals go, .75$ just seemed like a good number."
1442,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not really fair to change the rules after the fact.
1443,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just wanted x to get some sort of compensation
1444,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not know what the outcome would be and I of course want to be able to have some of the distribution but I want to make sure others get some as well.
1445,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was so close that I figured x was intitled to some of the money.
1446,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should be paid something for their time.  They completed 10 problems, so I think it fair that they receive at leasy $0.50."
1447,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel its OK to give all of the earnings to the person that answer more questions correctly than the other
1448,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was a small gap between problems solved, so I felt it was fair to give X some money for their efforts."
1449,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seemed the most fair that each participant that agreed to complete the task should get equal compensation, despite the results"
1451,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The time and effort the researcher put in
1452,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's to complicated for me.
1453,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X still attempted to answer the questions and got 5 correct, of course the initial 0.0 total earnings is fair per the study rules, but I figure that a low form of payment wouldn't hurt Person Y's earnings too much and still give X something for their time spent."
1454,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to redistribute some money because person X still completed some problems and deserves to be recognized. But since they did not complete as many problems they dont deserve as much money
1455,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although participant X did not get as many correct as Y, there was still effort involved in attempting to do it.  Therefore, I felt that some compensation was due."
1456,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think if both of the participants get some sort of monetary compensation for their time, they will be fine, even if they know that they have less than when they started. And since it's evenly split down the middle, everyone wins."
1457,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it should be a winner take all scenario.
1458,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel the correct answers were very close and it is more of a thanks for trying amount.
1459,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They also made an effort at partaking in the task. I feel they should be rewarded.
1460,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Anyone who spends 10 minutes doing a task should receive SOME compensation. so I gave participant X the amount to the right of the decimal point of participant Y's earnings.  This gave X some compensation, while Y received a much larger share.  The text did not say these were bonuses, so I assumed these were the only earnings.  Had the text stated that these were bonuses, to be paid in addition to other compensation, I would have given participant X nothing."
1461,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The methodology was confusing to me so I felt the reward should be more evenly distributed
1462,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that person Y only had one more correct answer compared to person X and I felt that it would be better to split the difference because I would feel bad just sending one person money when they were so close and it also doesn't compare the quality of the answers they did one might have missed easier questions or guessed answers so I decided to split even
1463,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They made the effort and should be compensated for it. Certainly not as much as the winner, but an amount commensurate with their efforts"
1464,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because that was the rules and it wouldnt be fair to the opponet or any other players.
1465,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They almost completed as many tasks.  they should get a smaller reward, but not as much as the winner did."
1466,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just wanted to give something to x for the effort. However, they don't deserve alot since they didn't achieve much."
1468,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X performed higher than many of their peers, more so than Participant Y. I gave Participant X their prorata share of total correct questions answered for the pair."
1469,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Ijust decided every participant should retain what he has
1470,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  not sure
1471,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X deserved a token for the 9 correctly solved problems, however much they fell short of Participant Y's"
1472,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was ensuring that X receives some compensation for their participation but still respecting the fact that Y performed better
1473,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the earnings should be shared because both attempted the task however the individual that dos better should be paid more
1474,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  based on my understanding on the chart given
1475,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $0.50 to acknowledge participant Xs effort while still rewarding Ys higher performance. This decision balances merit-based fairness with a small gesture of empathy, recognizing both contributions without significantly altering the original incentive structure. It reflects fairness without undermining the rules communicated to participants."
1476,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They solved 3 less problems so I know they worked hard so I believe they deserve something.
1477,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't feel that it's right for one participant to get nothing at all.
1478,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clear and I see no reason to take from the winner in this case.
1479,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did get some right, so there should be some sort of payment"
1480,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y performed better, therefore should be fully intitled to the Reward."
1481,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Xdid answer 11 questions. Even though Yanswered 4 more wuestions-I feel X should be given something for trying to answer as many as she could.
1482,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y and X were close, so they both deserve something."
1483,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well, Y earned their money fair and square, solving more problems. But X still put in the work and got nothing, which kinda sucks. So, I figured giving X a little something, like 50 cents, would be a decent compromise. It's not taking a ton from Y, but it makes it so X doesn't walk away with absolutely nothing after trying."
1484,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt the effort of participant X merited compensation because their effort was comparable to Y.
1486,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned that bonus fairly and deserves to keep it all.
1487,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since both participants had previously accepted the rules and Participant Y had performed better, I decided not to redistribute.  Modifying the result after the fact would compromise the study's integrity, effort-based rewards, and fairness."
1488,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the decision-making task was purely chance, I would say to share the money. But if time and thought went into solving the problems, Participant Y earned the money. That was based on skill and intellect.  I am okay with getting paid for skill and intellect."
1489,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He did 1/3 as good so gets 1/3 the pay
1490,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did well. X should still receive the majority of the earnings.
1491,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to redistribute any of the earnings participant Y got because both participants had agreed on clear rules before the task began. Participant Y ended up performing better and thereby earned payment for their services. There should definitely be respect for that structure; especially, since the results of Y's work suggest a great deal of effort. Although fairness does matter to me, in this particular case fairness should be toward acknowledging the contribution on which the payments are based."
1492,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules stated that they would be paid 0.15 if hey got around the other participants amount and nothing if they solved less. The participant solved significantly less problems than their partner. Not only that, but the money is coming out of the the participant who solved the most. I don't think it's fair to punish them for their success."
1493,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the person who did better should keep the full reward. They solved more problems so they earned it.
1494,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y had many more correct answers , so they earned the reward and should not have to share it."
1495,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i felt that participant X made some right answers and should be rewarded something like that
1496,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like they deserve at least a small amount for getting 1/3 of the questions right.
1497,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like participant X lost by 6 to participant Y. Because of their results being close, I feel like participant X should b rewarded something for solving some right."
1498,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  reduced 2nd place award. not equal
1499,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't want to give earnings away
1500,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The payment for performance rule was clearly explained and one participant did not earn any payment. I will not penalize the person that did earn the payment.
1501,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they all put in effort to solve the problems. Participant X solved 9 and Y solved 16. Despite the difference, they all deserve to earn something for the effort."
1502,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel the difference between participant X and Y wasn't really much and participant X deserves a little share too.
1503,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any earnings because the rules were clear from the start. Only the participant who solved more problems would receive payment. Participant Y performed better and earned the reward fairly.
1504,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They earned their money based on their knowledge. They deserve it.
1506,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant X deserve a little amount for his contribution and shouldn't be rewarded with nothing.
1507,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like player x deserved something for his/her efforts.
1508,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The basic setup was unfair. I think a prorated distribution is fairer.
1509,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think this is fair since participant X did solve 4 problems. I believe they deserve some reward.
1510,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   rule, while largely preserving Y's deserved reward for superior performance."
1511,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X and Participant Y both completed at least 10 problems (though of course Participant Y did 16 problems, which was more than X). Participant Y will still walk away with the majority of their earnings, and Participant X will receive a very small compensation for at least having done 10 problems."
1512,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In order for it to be fair enough because they both participated in doing the tasks
1513,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned more by solving significantly more problems. Since the reward was based on performance, it seems fair that they keep their full earnings"
1514,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The first reason is to acknowledge the effort, and the other one is to ensure I am fair"
1515,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were very clear as to the distribution of earnings. Participant X did not meet the requirements for any payment.
1516,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think for how much the other contributed about half of what the other feels fair.
1517,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think it's fair that X didn't earn any USD since they solved 13 problems, which is 1 less that Y. So, I think it's fair to give X 1.0 and Y can have 1.1 since they solved 1 extra problem."
1518,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they were only one question off, they still did almost the same amount of work- more luck than talent or doing such exceptional work that they deserve it. they placed almost the same, they should both be compensated for their time."
1519,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To make it more even for both participants.
1520,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant who got 11 questions right should also be compensated because the difference between the two participants is not significant.
1522,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  $0.85 redistribution was a compromise: it offers Participant X some compensation for their time and effort while still ensuring Participant Y retains a substantial majority of their earned amount, reflecting their higher achievement in the task."
1523,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They deserve at least something for their efforts..
1524,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I have no interest in providing extra money.
1525,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didnt redistribute because both people knew the rules at the startwhoever did better would get paid. Y earned it fair and square by solving more problems, so it makes sense they keep it all."
1526,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that paticipant X also tried and hence should be compensted even though it should be slightly lower than participant Y's earnings.
1527,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This decision is based on the principle of performance-based reward.
1528,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It still rewards the higher performer more so but I still want to give X something for their effort.
1529,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  By being human and caring I will award participant X to make him feel motivated.
1530,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  fair is fair
1532,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to make it as equal as possible. They both deserve something for trying.
1533,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were set and participant X agreed to them before the start of the assignment
1534,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Honestly don't think that this sort of redistribution is fair - person Y earned that money by doing 19 different tasks. They actually did the work. Person X did not do much at all. At the same time, though, I understand that this is supposed to be a representation of taxes. And I am annoyed at the decision I made, because I do believe in the redistribution of actual wealth when it comes to the uber rich and everyone fucking else. When you have millions of dollars you can afford to have some of your money handed to someone else. When you're making pocket change via things like Prolific, though, that's a different story."
1535,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This choice offers a balanced redistribution that acknowledges Participant X's effort while maintaining incentives for performance.
1536,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tried to be fair and equal out the earnings because they were close in getting the answers correct.
1537,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant X also took their time to participate. It is worthy.
1538,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not believe in concept of redistribution. You do not get rewarded for effort. You are rewarded for results.
1539,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was random
1540,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like Participant X solved approximately a third of the problems, so I gave them roughly one third of the earnings."
1541,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though they did extremely poorly, they should get paid at least something. I thought 25 cents was fair."
1542,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not a lot of money, so it's not such a big deal to redistribute. I think the original terms of the compensation were a bit unfair, so I wanted to even things out a bit. I gave a bit more money to the person who performed better, but I wanted the other person to also get compensated for their time."
1543,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were told the rules of the game and played it, Im fine with the results"
1544,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Given that Participant X solved a significant number of problems (14) but received no earnings due to the rule, I decided to redistribute 1.00 USD from Participant Y's earnings to acknowledge Participant X's effort and ensure a more equitable outcome for their work."
1547,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to recognize X effort while keeping most of the reward to Y
1548,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Who am I to judge other people and their behavior or skill or performance or supposed value to the community?  I do not wish to be so judged; therefore, I will not so judge.  I believe we each have a personal responsibility to care for all others on this planet.  Thus my hope is that the individuals with more resources will assist those in poverty to achieve a level on steady & sustainable basic subsistence and to be supported to flourish through education & opportunity that individuals with more can share.  But it is not up to me to tell others what they must do.  I can only live my life guided by kindness and be grateful to others who feel the same.  I believe that capitalism, when it was conceptualized, assumed human beings would not leave others to die.  This is no longer true.  I cannot change that.  Kindness -- as a choice -- can."
1549,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I prefer to stick with the original rule. I disagree with wealth redistribution.
1550,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   for the questions answered vs. pay given.
1551,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think solving 15 problems means that they won. It sort of seemed like a contest, or competition."
1552,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give X something for the work they put in
1553,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I mostly based it out of the rules that each participant agreed upon before they started the task. It would be very unfair to reward participant X with anything.
1554,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Almost Equality with inherent rewards
1555,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y demonstrated a lot of effort solving all the questions they solved, and that is enough to deserve all their coins. I wouldn't want person X thinking they solved more questions than the next person by receiving a bonus too, because 8 to 21 questions shows me there was a lack of effort."
1556,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just followed the original set of rules.
1557,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would like to share the amount given according to the participant performance. Participant y performed higher than x therefore earn 2 $ while x earns 1 $ to appreciate each for their time and effort.
1558,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didnt donate as much to the second person because I feel each person should get the money they deserve
1559,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They werent even close so the one who worked harder should get their full earnings.
1560,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because it seem like the most logical answer
1561,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The second player seemed to also have done well / tried
1562,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It would be unfair to take Y's bonus when they earned it, even if it is a little sad that X didn't get anything. They were aware of the instructions and we should adhere to them."
1563,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave \$1.21 to Participant X to fairly reflect their effort, as they solved 42.4% of the total problems. This proportional split rewards both participants based on their contributions."
1565,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It would be fair becuase participant x also participated
1566,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant took part in the survey so should get some reward
1567,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  As a participant I know that it can be encouraging to receive at least a small bonus payment.
1568,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved nearly as many problems as Participant Y yet had no earnings. I chose to make the payment reflect how many problems they solved.
1569,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did the work, and do deserve a little compensation."
1570,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the payout should be a little more fair for both participants
1571,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did almost as well, so not giving them anything doesn't feel fair"
1572,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it will help the participant.
1573,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  What motivated me to take that decision was I believe in giving when others don't have
1574,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It didn't need to be changed, there was a nice bell curve already."
1575,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I dont think it would be fair to take from one participant when they did so much better
1576,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i opted not to distribute any of participants Y's earnings because we were both informed of the rules before the completing the task
1577,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should be rewarded for their time.
1578,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that Particpant X earned all of the money because they answered more questions correctly.
1579,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant y won their earnings fairly
1580,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If things are out of my control, I contribute nothing."
1581,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved solved almost half of participant Y's correct answers. I therefore feel that participant X should earn a quarter of Y's earnings.
1582,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For motivation and for having comleted the 13 tasks
1583,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It gives clear details about the note
1585,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y performed many more than X. Since Y put in most of the effort, Y should keep all of their earnings."
1586,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any earnings because participant Y clearly outperformed participant X by solving significantly more problems (19 vs. 6). The rules of the task were clear: earnings were based on relative performance. Since Y earned their reward fairly through higher effort or ability, I believe it is just to let them keep the full amount."
1588,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Rewards should be based on results.  Distribution of wealth is a marxist policy.
1589,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to compensate participate x for their effort.
1591,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they get a split earnings for both participation.
1592,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  compansation for his time
1593,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was thinking of fairness. Just because Y scored more points than X, it does not mean X did not put in effort. So, to acknowledge their effort, I thought rewarding them 10% of Y's award was reasonable while also acknowledging that Y performed way better."
1595,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.50 to participant X because, while participant Y clearly performed better and deserves the majority of the earnings, I also believe it's fair to recognize effort and provide some support to the lower-performing participant. This way, the distribution reflects both merit and compassion"
1596,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wouldnt give any of Ys earnings to X because they both knew the rules going in, only the person who solved more problems would get paid. Y did better and earned that money fair and square. It might feel a bit harsh not to share, especially since X put in effort too, but changing things afterward wouldnt feel right. Its important to respect the agreement they signed up for."
1597,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Changing the rules after they have already been set and explained isn't right.
1598,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute the full amount from participant Y to participant X because I believe that effort should be recognized more equitably, even in competitive settings. Although participant Y outperformed participant X, both individuals dedicated time and effort to the task. The original reward structure was quite strictoffering nothing to someone who performed reasonably well but slightly worse. Full redistribution reflects a preference for reducing sharp disparities and promoting a more equal outcome, especially when the performance gap, while real, does not necessarily justify a total loss of reward for participant X."
1599,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  12 is a pretty decent amount to solve, there should be some compensation"
1600,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  People should keep all of their earnings based on their efforts.
1601,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to split the earnings equally because both participants performed at a very high level, with only a one-question difference out of 24. It seems unfair that participant X should receive nothing despite solving 21 problems correctly. Dividing the reward acknowledges both merit and fairness, recognizing that their efforts were nearly equal."
1602,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was based on fairness and adherence to the clearly stated rules. Participant Y earned more by solving more problems, and both participants were aware of the conditions beforehand. Redistributing the earnings after the fact would undermine the transparency and merit-based structure of the task. Keeping the full payment with participant Y respects the effort, performance, and fairness of the original agreement."
1603,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason I chose to give x 1 dollar was because I honestly felt bad that one person got 3 dollars and the other person got nothing. I felt they both at least should of got something.
1604,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned it. X didnt. Rules were clear. No reason to redistribute.
1605,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The difference between Participant X and Y was minimal only one problem. To balance fairness and incentive, I redistributed a small portion ($0.45) to acknowledge Xs effort while still rewarding Y for performing slightly better. This maintains motivation to perform well while recognizing near-equal contributions."
1607,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would have given a small amount to the first person as a minimum payment for participating, like 0.15.  but the rules promised the other participant the entire $2.69 based on their work and it wouldn't be fair to them to take away what they were promised."
1608,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because x did participate and earned a little.
1609,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am really good at math, so I got a rough estimate of 2.55 divided by 31, then multiplied by the number X got correct (14) which was roughly 1.15 which seems fair to me."
1610,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because both participants completed a similar number of problems, it is fair that they both receive something, though the majority should go to the winner."
1611,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Splitting in half would be unfair considering participant Y still answered more questions correctly but participant X still scored a decent amount (3 less than the other participant). Their effort should be rewarded
1612,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The selection is because X scored less than half of Y's scores. Therefore, Y deserves the biggest chunk. However, X still made some effort, hence the little allocation made."
1613,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because Y only earn 0.07 and it would not increase x that much
1614,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 18 problems while participant Y solved 19 problems, it'd be very unfair if participant X isn't given any reward for their efforts, Participant Y has just one point ahead of participant, that shouldn't mean participant X gets nothing, This is what motivated my decision."
1615,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told before answering the questions that if they answered less questions than whoever they ended up being paired with, then they wouldn't earn a bonus.  Since the consequences were clearly stated, I see no reason to change that."
1616,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  did not do as many as the other participant
1617,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant y earned their bonus, and the rules say that x needed to match"
1618,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want participant X to be paid the same rate as participant Y.
1619,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to simply keep things the same
1620,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also had some points so they deserve to earn some cash
1621,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To be fair and make sure both get paid for their work they put into the tasks.
1622,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   system will be fair to both parties who took on the task within such conditions. Violating such rules would undermine the incentives presented in the experiment.
1623,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I put into consideration the  effort candidate x put and in my wisdom it would be totally un fair to let him go with nothing
1624,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that X deserved something for their effort since they did try. They did not deserve the same amount since Y did far better.
1625,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were given and based on the rules the amount would be distributed.  There should not be a change in the rules after the fact.
1626,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The better-performing participant should keep their own payout.
1627,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Yes I think earnings should be on your own merit
1628,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tend to look at tasks such as members X and Y to participated in as team events. Therefore extraordinary performers don't receive more than those who don't do as well but the team is rewarded
1629,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X deserves a payment because of their effort and participation.
1630,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant put in an effort too so it does not seem right that they are not paid.
1631,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though it doesn't follow the stated rules, it seemed fair to compensate the person for answering 15 questions."
1632,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  with the amount of effort put in both should get something
1633,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant y solved almost twice as many.
1634,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the main reason as for my decision is because the participants knew the rules and made a choice to take part and were ready for tne final outcome was it to be bad or good
1635,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y performed better and therefore deservers most of the earnings. Participant X still deserves something for completing the task at least, even if just a bit."
1636,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision is to share the distribution between the two.  The sharing is not divided equally but a greater portion remains with the original person, X."
1637,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by balancing the initial rules with acknowledging effort. I aimed to provide Participant X some compensation for their solved problems, while respecting Participant Y's superior performance."
1638,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The second participant outperformed the first one and should be rewarded.
1639,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was just a matter of how many problems each participant tackled and i decided to split accordingly.
1640,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give participant X $1 due to the reason that they have solved 17 problems and were only one behind participant Y, demonstrating that they tried their best. Although the initial regulations are straightforward, I considered that such a slight difference in performance outcome was unfair enough to fail entirely. I wished to eliminate a bit of this inequality without taking the effort away in performing better. I never opposed the performance-based reward system by still allowing Y to keep the majority of the earned money. In general, the basis of my choice was fairness and awareness of effort."
1641,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  percentage based on number solved
1642,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both did the task that took their time, it shouldn't matter the outcome so much"
1643,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of Participant Ys earnings because the payment rules were clear and agreed upon by both participants beforehand. Participant Y earned their reward by significantly outperforming Participant X, and I believe it is fair to respect the structure and effort-based incentives of the task. Changing the distribution after the fact could undermine the purpose of rewarding performance."
1644,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Partcipant X should be rewarded for the effort made as an incentive.
1645,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should keep the money that they earned
1646,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted them to have something but give a little bit more to Y because they got more right.
1647,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Im hoping its a fair amount
1649,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought of it as a winner take all scenario.
1650,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I will be ok with your choice.
1651,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tried to be fair and distribute them roughly according to how many problems they solved. It did not feel fair for one participant to get nothing since it could have been they could not solve the problems for reasons outside their control/ability.
1652,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I think its unfair/unkind to ask someone to do something like solve problems and then not pay them for it when that is the entire reason we are all here.
1654,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose $1.25 to participant X because its a fair balance between rewarding participant Ys better performance and recognizing participant Xs effort.
1655,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did 8 while Y did 14. That's at least half right from X so while he did do worse than Y, that 0.10 might feel ok. Way better than nothing."
1656,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision is driven by the need for fairness in distribution of resources
1657,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to redistribute $1.00 to participant X because, although participant Y performed better and earned the full amount under the original rules, participant X also made a significant effort and came relatively close in performance. Sharing a portion of the earnings helps recognize that effort and promotes fairness, while still allowing participant Y to retain the majority of their reward."
1658,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant who won deserves the full payment.
1659,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that participant X put forth a good effort and should be rewarded
1660,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The difference between both participants was by only two, which I believe should be rewarded if the participant's work was effortful and meaningful."
1661,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should be given 15 cents if he or she gets many points as the other participant.  In this case participant X has a fewer points so he or she gets 0.00 USD.
1662,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While participant Y completed 3 times the amount of task as X participant X did still take an attempt and completed 8 to not be paid at all feels unfair
1663,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   I wanted to be fair but also kind. Both of them tried, after all. It was a competition, sure, but a small handout to X shows I saw the effort without taking away from Y's win. I think you can stick to the rules and still be a decent person."
1664,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules are clear. Both X and Y participated knowing their payoff could be zero. The researcher set the rules. Blame the researcher. This is not liberal income re-distribution scam.
1665,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Per the rule, the participant that solved more problem will earn 2.85 USD and the other that solved less will earn 0.0 USD. Participant X solved less problem, hence earning 0.0 USD."
1666,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not believe in wealth redistribution in this situation.
1667,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While participant X did not score as much as person Y, they still participated in the task and deserve be compensated somehow. However, The latter still earned their fair share and do not deserve to lose much of it to make the compensation fair."
1668,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did twice as many problems and got nothing; that seems unfair. I took half because Participant X did half the problems.
1669,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Everyone has a part to play
1670,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like the other player should still receive something given that he/she was able to answer some questions, albeit less than the other player. Still, I think it's fair to give the other player at least some earnings."
1671,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would like to still be kind and split some
1672,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were very clear at the beginning of their contest. Participant Y earned the money. They answered more questions correctly then X did. I do not believe in wage redistribution.
1673,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though X may not have done as much work I believe they should be given some kind of compensation.
1674,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think whats earned on platforms like this is yours, its too competitive and dog eat dog"
1675,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just think it is fair if participate x receives something as well for solving 11 problems
1676,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it was only a difference of a few, so I think each deserves something"
1677,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the payment is performance-based, I would not redistribute any of participant Ys earnings."
1678,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well X will not work as hard and long as Y but X still will do some work so I think some compensation is earned.
1679,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that the bonus Y recieved for winning was already quite small, so although I like it more when both earn no matter what and mabe Y could've just earned more, there was just simply no room to cut the amount down that made sense with the scenario."
1680,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision prioritizes adhering to the pre-established rules of the study. Redistributing earnings would be unfair to Participant Y, who met the stated conditions for payment."
1682,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave 0.2 from participant Y to the other participant because it just felt right and fair to do that. PArticipant X tried so much and they solved about 11 problems even though Y did better. I just wanted to make sure their hard work just doesn't go to waste too.
1683,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned that money by answering more problems correctly. They deserve the entire payment. Unfortunately, Participant X did not answer many of the problems correctly. They did not earn a bonus in my mind."
1684,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I included fairness since both of them got to participate , in as much as Y did more , X still deserved pay for participation"
1685,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did pretty well, so I gave them a small percentage (11%)."
1686,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because both participants deserved some type of payment for their efforts
1687,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I understand that person X did way less than person Y in terms of the number of tasks. Still, they did take some time to do tasks, so they should be compensated somehow"
1689,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also solved the problem and did almost as much as Participant Y. Participant X scored 0.075 while Participant Y 0.07.
1690,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants did well so they both deserve something
1691,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   rule's impact on an average performer.    Conversely, Participant Y's 20 solved problems represent exceptional performance, clearly in the high end of the distribution. It is crucial to substantially reward this superior achievement. Allowing Y to retain $2.50 of their initial $3.00 payout provides strong incentive for high performance, maintaining a clear distinction for outstanding effort while still offering a measure of fairness to X."
1692,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X made a good effort and should get some payment
1693,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant y earned their money, why would they give it away?"
1695,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I added the total of their questions and divided the money and then shared the profits based on questions answered, rather than who did the most. Each questions was ~.08 cents so I divided it that way to the best of my ability."
1696,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did a great job in my opinion and almost got the same score as participant Y, so it is only fair if they received a dollar for their performance."
1697,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like it would be nice to give X some bonus.  I don't want to take away too much from Y, because they earned/won it, but I still want to give X something."
1698,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered almost the same amount of questions
1699,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought they should get something but I also though Y should get the most because they got the most correct.
1700,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It just seemed fair to me.
1701,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Shouldnt both people get money..?
1702,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think people should be compensated equally for a prolific task, and for many things in life."
1703,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant perform way below standard and below the other participant paired with them
1704,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Do not think the rules should be changed mid-task.
1705,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel for trying participant X deserves something
1706,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They earned 40% of Y's earnings, so I distributed 40% of that amount."
1707,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To encourage participant X to solve more problems next time
1708,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate Y worked harder than x
1709,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Maximum amount seemed fair given the rules
1710,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe everyone should receieve some compensation for their time.
1711,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It sucks that one person got no bonus when they probably also worked hard, so I redistributed some money."
1712,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't think that participant X should get quite as much as participant Y, but it didn't seem fair for them to get nothing, either."
1713,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the participants were already given the rules for how the money would be awarded, then it's only fair to stick to that unless they original participants decide together (or in this case for the participant who is being awarded for the tasks decides)."
1714,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that participant X should at least be compensated for doing the study .
1715,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules are clear. You get paid .15 per correct answer, only if you score at least as high as the other person."
1716,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X made some real effort in solving the problems. He solved more than 50% of the total solved by participant Y. It is my opinion that they should get something too.
1717,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it seems fair if they answered more questions correctly. They should be rewarded
1718,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were that if you answer fewer questions than the other participant, you win nothing. The rules shouldn't be broken just because you feel bad that someone lost. Participant Y performed better, and earned their money fairly. Nothing should be taken away from Participant Y, when they were the winner, according to the rules."
1719,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fair given the amount of work each had to do
1720,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If I get involved than I bear responsibility. If I don't get involved it wasn't my fault. I don't care to get involved.
1721,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think most problem solved person is winner. So highest amount will be only given by this person.
1722,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason that motivated my decision is the fact that both participants knew the rules before they participated, and participant y solved the most problems."
1723,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of Participant Ys earnings because both participants agreed to a clear set of rules before completing the task. The payment structure was based on relative performance, and Y earned their reward fairly by solving significantly more problems than X. Redistributing earnings after the fact would undermine the fairness of the original agreement and reduce the incentive to perform well. My decision is based on respecting merit, effort, and the integrity of the rules both participants accepted."
1724,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clear and agreed to by the participants. Only the higher scoring participant would get the reward.
1725,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  you stated the rule of the game, the players played, it is only fitting the result is granted according to the rules"
1726,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I opted to not redistribute any earnings, since the clearly laid out rules were relative performance based. Participant Y clearly earned their payment under the rules given, as they solved more than twice as many problems compared to Participant X. Changing the outcome after the task would break the incentive structure and fair notice of the agreement."
1727,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules of the activity were set beforehand. Both knew what would happen if one person did better than the other. Although X did fairly well overall, Y answered more correct. I don't think it is fair to change the rules and readjust after the activity was completed."
1728,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X doesn't have any payment and have been given a choice to allocate money from person Y, I will only be fair if money is allocated to person Y."
1729,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I feel person x should get at least something instead of 0.0
1730,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I have decided not to allocate any amount to participant X because they solved fewer problems than participant Y.
1731,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y still comes out ahead or a winner but x is not a total looser
1732,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Surveys are not done for altruistic reasons
1733,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  
1734,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Before both participant began the task, they were informed that they would be paired with another, randomly determined, participant and that their earnings will be based on performance. 15 cents for every correct answer and the least performing participant gets nothing, so it is only fair that we give participant Y his/her rightfully earned amount. This was the premise for the study, and hence all participants are aware and don't deserve to be pitied  at the expense of the other."
1735,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because X tried they should get something for their time
1736,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like its fair that both participants get some amount of money. They both contributed equally and should both get money
1737,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe participant X should still receive a portion for their contribution to the problems.
1738,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That was the rule of the game that the one who solves the greater problems gets the reward. Hence, i did not see the need to split, participant Y earned it all"
1739,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y worked extra hard to earn the payment, we should not deduct their payment."
1740,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believed the top performer deserved a high reward for his performance than participant Y
1741,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is fair enough to award the little efforts someone does
1742,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because participant xdid 8 and y 15 participant did haft
1743,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I they should both be paid for their accomplishments, and I tried to divide it according to how many each got correctly."
1744,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y won the competition fair and square by answering more questions. I don't think it's fair to take any of their earnings away and give it to Participant X.
1745,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X was able to solve some of the problem and must be awarded according to the effort the participant put in.
1746,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision not to redistribute any of Participant Ys earnings is based on the principle of merit-based fairness and respect for pre-established rules.
1747,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  out of generosity, and despite the rules, X should get some credit for the work"
1748,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That is the agreement you made with the two participants, so I am going to honor it."
1749,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided not to give any of Ys earnings to X because the rules were clear from the start: you only earn money if you do as well or better than the other person. Y solved more problems and earned the reward fairly. Changing that after the fact didnt feel right, it would be unfair to take money from someone who followed the rules and did well."
1752,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   for having participated in the experiment. Participant Y's earnings were only marginally affected by this decision, and I wanted Participant X to receive an unanticipated reward because, however meager."
1754,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It only seems fair their profits should be shared
1755,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Id give $0.75 to participant X and let participant Y keep $2.25. Y did an impressive job and definitely earned their reward, so it feels right that they keep most of it. But X also worked hard and solved a good number of problems it just seems fair to recognize that effort a little bit. This way, both people walk away with something that reflects how much they contributed."
1756,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was only 1 more then the other
1757,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  what motivated my decision is, not knowing who the participant is"
1758,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered the questions and earned it.
1759,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because he  solved many questions
1760,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate y won fair and square the rules were the person who solved more. I think that person deserves the money and X doesn't regardless of how much he solved.
1761,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They played the game together they get the share equally.
1762,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I split it up somewhat so that it would be more even and more fair.
1763,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based on the relative closeness of both scores, it seems fair."
1764,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the effort was put in by the person to complete the task , he deserves for the effort, time and work he put in to complete"
1765,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like both participants should get an equal share based on how much the other earned.
1766,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give **\$0.60 to Participant X** and **\$1.20 to Participant Y** in order to strike a balance between **rewarding performance** and promoting a sense of **fairness and compassion**. While Participant Y clearly outperformed X and deserves a larger share, I believe its unnecessarily harsh for X to receive nothing at all, especially since both participants put in effort. This moderate redistribution acknowledges merit while recognizing the human tendency to care about others' outcomes, even in competitive settings."
1768,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not feel they should be penalized for not getting as many answers. I redistributed the payment to give the person with more correct answers double the amount, 0.10 for correct answers to the person with the most and 0.05 for the correct answers to the person with less correct. I based this off of what I would feel is fair if I were the second person."
1769,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason is that participant X actually did something, so it would be nice to give them a share."
1770,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x and y in total solved 28 problem that is 11 plus 17. the total given to y is 2.55. I divided 2.55 by the 28 corect responses.  getting a value of 0.091071 then multiplied by the correct responses of x ie 11 and got 1.
1771,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   pairing rule.
1772,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that participant X and participant Y, since they did a nearly identical amount of work, should both be entitled to similar compensation. Even though participant Y did better than participant X, it is not fair to go without paying participant X for their work."
1773,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Everyone likes an increament in payments so ill tend to work hard, and again i will alway try to surpass the control experiment person"
1774,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't want to change the rules after the fact. It would be more fair for Participant X if I redistributed earnings, but that would also be unfair to Participant Y. Both agreed to a specific set of rules at the outset and those rules should be enforced. Both participants worked as hard as they could and should be compensated according to the rules they agreed to initially."
1776,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X was close to Y, so I gave X a small part to be fair."
1777,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both participated, so they should both walk away with something."
1778,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel it's fair to give X something. They did answer 15 questions correctly. It's still not half of what Y earned. It's fair to give Y more for the sheer number of answers that were correct.
1779,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant X knew the rules of the payout, and thus consented to receiving $0. There is no reason to detract from the other participant Y's earnings"
1780,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There should be no redistribution as the competitors played under a set of rules that has to be honored in order to make the competition legitimate.
1781,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules to the task were fair with the higher achiever being rewarded unless the participant with the lower score at least equaled the winner in performance.  I don't see a reason to redistribute earnings.
1782,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to make the payments a lot more even, especially since they only differed by one completed task overall.  I didn't feel it was fair to make a full 50/50 split given that one was slightly ahead and they received instructions that directly stated they would be paid more if they did better than another, so I rounded down and gave them the same overall dollar amount with the one who performed better getting an extra 15 cents.  This felt like the most fair way to distribute the reward given all of this information together."
1783,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I like to be as equally fair as possible.
1784,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X at least solved 13 problems and deserves a reward
1785,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant Y completed more tasks than participant X. Participant X knew the rules for payment distribution and continued with the study. Participant Y earned the funds, and it would be wrong to redistribute their earnings."
1787,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that although participant X only solved 11 problems, they should still receive some money for their effort."
1788,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Not making a choice to be fair.
1789,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants knew that their pay would be affected by their performance. This makes the pay amounts fair and there are no adjustments needed.
1790,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant was only 2 questions from being a tie with the other participant.
1791,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X put effort into the task, and even though they solved fewer problems than Participant Y, I think they should receive at least some compensation for their time and effort."
1792,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think by doing so i will be fair enough.
1793,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt the first participant that solved 15 problems tried hard and worked hard, so they should receive some kind of recognition.  I awarded them a small bonus."
1794,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While one participant performed better payment would not be possible without the other's participation.
1795,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Those were the established rules, I am just following them."
1796,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think a few right answers warrants payment for time and effort.
1797,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There were 20 total problems solved. X solved 40% of them. I calculated 40% of the reward and rounded down.
1798,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I could not transfer more than 2.55 so I chose 2.
1799,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y won fair and square.
1800,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think I will do better than an unknown person
1801,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the one participant scored much better than the other
1802,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Half
1803,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  no reason, just a hunch"
1804,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well I wanted to be fair
1805,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should get something for their right answers.
1806,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  not leaving someone with nothing
1807,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since they both showed a lot of effort and were very close in scores, I thought it would be fair to redistribute some portion so that both are compensated for their effort. Also, I would not have redistributed if the participants weren't told there would be some additional criteria for bonus payment but since that was explained up front, I did opt to give some of the bonus to the lower scoring participant."
1808,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Sharing some funds, but also since they performed less, I wanted to keep bulk with second participant."
1809,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  hose not to redistribute any of participant Ys earnings because the rules of the task clearly stated that earnings would only be granted if a participant performed at least as well as their counterpart.
1810,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe in fairness even though this was to be a competition.  I want everyone to win something!
1811,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He only got six less answers right so I kind of like just cut it in thirds
1812,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person earned it and should have what they earned.
1813,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants contributed almost equally and to demonstrate fairness, i decided that each participant should get a reward."
1814,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told the rules. The participant who answered 13 questions correctly should not be punished because the other participant answered only 2 correctly. Likewise, the lower-performing participant should not be rewarded for underperforming."
1815,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  50/50 split
1817,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  he solved halve as many problems as y so seems fair
1818,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should get some compensation for completing some of the tasks
1819,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  On a normal participant X should not get anything but due to time and energy invested in the task i had to make that decision.
1820,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i don't feel like i should move money around, it shouldn't be up to me."
1821,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Given that both participants agreed to the rules ahead of time and redistribution could feel unfair to the higher performer who met the challenge, I choose not to redistribute any of participant Y's earnings to participant X"
1822,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Recognition of Effort: Participant X solved 8 problems, which shows meaningful effort. Giving a small portion of Ys earnings acknowledges that work, even though X didnt win the competition.    Preserving Incentives: Participant Y solved more problems and followed the rules successfully. They should retain the majority of their earnings to preserve the incentive for strong performance.    Fairness with Compassion: The redistribution reflects a balance respecting the merit-based rules while showing a degree of fairness and empathy toward the losing participant."
1823,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both got almost the same amount correct with only one person getting one more correct than the other.  Since they participated together they should split the reward.
1824,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just wanted them to share it
1825,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both completed the task, and both did fairly well-- pattern recognition tasks are difficult.  Therefore, their earnings, which are initially blind to each other, should be split evenly."
1826,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate Y had obviously done more studies, and sense the base pay for this was 2 dollars, then I came to the conclusion that each point they got would be worth a specific amount. That is why I believe that participant X deserves 0.15 of the pay form participant Y."
1827,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Everyone should be paid for their time and this way the one that did better receives the majority and the other receives less, but still receives a payment for their time."
1828,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   Participants were aware that payment depended on outperforming their partner; Participant Y met this condition, Participant X did not."
1829,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because of the selected question
1830,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Sharing is caring.  I assume that Both participant X and Y gave their best and its just good to be fair.
1831,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the margin between the two participants are not so vast, I decided a minimal amount would be fair."
1832,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did a little better, so they should get most of the money. But X was really close, so I think they deserve something too. I wanted to be fair without ignoring who won."
1833,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did significantly worse than the other participant. I thought about giving them twenty cents or so, but that just seemed insulting to both parties."
1834,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both solved the same amount of problems I felt it was only fair if each received half
1835,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should both be compensated, but since they were promised different outcomes the amount can be different."
1836,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Correctly solving 7 questions should earn that person some monetary reward.
1837,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  At least the person participated, meaning he/she had the desire to participate and take part in the study and thus, the person deserves a reward."
1838,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was to share between Y X and I made the right chose
1840,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  what i considered as a fair amount
1841,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute the earnings because participant Y solved more problems and met the criteria for payment, while participant X did not. The rules were clear from the beginning, and both participants agreed to them. Rewarding based on performance ensures fairness and maintains the integrity of the task."
1842,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y worked X didn't
1843,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe both should receive something, but participant X didn't solve many at all, and much less than participant Y so I think 25 cents is acceptable"
1844,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The margin was not that large and participant X also tried.
1845,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y fairly did better than X and as a result is entitled to keep what they rightfully earned.
1846,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the other person did nearly double the amount of work! It is not fair to take from them to give to someone who didn't work as hard
1847,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i wanted to give participant x 55 cents, but it would not accept that value so I choose 0."
1848,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do think it is a bit unfair that one participant did not receive any reward despite answering some of the questions. However, I also think it is unfair to take the money earned by the other participant, as it is not their fault that the researchers set up the reward structure/rules the way it is."
1849,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is fair to split the earnings between particpants.
1850,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the participant answered less questions than the other
1851,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Wanted to pay each about the same for their time
1852,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two people knew the rules of the task so taking money away from Y would not be fair.
1853,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am assuming that Participant X put time and effort into answering the questions also. It j7st seemed fair.
1854,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think both should be compensated for their effort but not evenly given the original instructions.
1855,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think everything was fair for all participants, therefore everyone had to work hard  Redistribution is not necessary"
1856,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  just wanted to split it between them
1857,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They shouldnt have to split it 50 / 50 however i think giving the participant with zero money is kind of unfair considering they took the time to still participate so 40 cents is alright to give the the participant with zero money.
1858,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason for my decision is fairness based on the agreed rules. Participant Y earned their reward by solving more problems, while Participant X was aware that earning less would result in no payment"
1859,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason that motivated me is that participant X completed 17 tasks and therefore they deserve to be paid
1860,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If i calculated right I wanted to make it even
1861,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that participant X should be compensated for receiving multiple items correct.
1862,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel bad giving zero but Im poor so I cant give everything
1863,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x solved fewer than why the rules say he gets nothing
1864,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to give $0.00 of participant Ys earnings to participant X was motivated by a commitment to fairness, merit, and respecting agreed-upon rules. Both participants were informed of the conditions before the task began: only the higher performer would be rewarded. Participant Y earned the payout by solving more problems, while participant X did not meet the threshold to earn money. Redistributing the earnings afterward would undermine the integrity of the incentive structure and create uncertainty for participants who relied on the original rules. Upholding the terms that were clearly communicated and agreed upon supports trust and fairness in the study."
1865,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While Participant Y did better and should probably keep more, I believe that anyone who at least put in an effort should be rewarded which is why I think X should get 1 dollar while Y gets 2."
1866,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the effort was very good the other participant only solved to less problems so the participant that solved 19 problems at $2.85 was paid approximately $.15 a problem so he got two more problems solved then
1867,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did do part of the work and therefore deserve some credit
1868,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved just five problems compared to participant Y and participant Y had a better performance and adhered to the laid down rules.
1869,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also spent the time to complete the study, so I feel there should be some compensation."
1870,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought for a low-stakes task that required two people, both should have similar payouts."
1872,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered 3 less than the other participant
1873,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were stated prior to participating
1874,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it seems fair.
1875,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Getting 9 questions right deserved some compensation, but not as much as 18. I based my decision on the ratio of right answers between the two people and distributed the money fairly, basically."
1876,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think everyone should be compensated for their time and attempt.
1877,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant A solved about half the problems of B so they should get at least a small reward.
1878,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X already gets a sum of money while Y gets none
1880,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X put in some effort and Participant Y didn't win by that much margin.
1881,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's only fair to reward the person that got the most correct
1882,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participan y deserved the full payment
1883,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just think that it is only fair to give the person 2.25 that he earned.
1884,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person should get 0 because they solved less problems than the other participant. The person who solved the most should get the full bonus in my opinion.
1886,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X was only one question short. It is fair to give the participant part of the money for his or her effort
1887,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They solved about the same number, but rules are rules, so just a little."
1888,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   then don't bother to do it at all. By doing so you will only teach the people to expect handouts and eventually nobody will try at all to do anything - they will just wait for the handout.
1889,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There should be a reward for correct answers. I calculated approximately how much each correct answer was worth then divided that by 18. Then multiplied it by 13 and split in half.
1890,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They went into it knowing the consequences if you don't get more than Y you get 0 it was all or nothing baybay and they participated and lost thats how it works why am I punishing Y because X has a skill issue?
1891,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not want someone to get nothing but I also did not want to take all the money from one person so I tried to go half.
1892,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any earnings because of if I did this it would go against the established terms of study,  z"
1893,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like any effort should be given some compensation although the winner did lead by a margin of 7 so they should be rewarded accordingly
1894,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was fair to try to distribute money equally but more to the person who is offering to share.
1895,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute a small portion of Ys earnings to X to balance fairness and effort.

1897,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe the lion's share of reward should be attributed to the individual bearing most of the time / expense.
1898,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt bad for the participant who didn't get any money despite solving 10 problems. I didn't want to take too much from the other participant, so that's why I only took 20 cents from them."
1899,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Maybe I didn't understand but I am assuming that the participant that completed that answered 13 correctly was also paid .15 for each correct answer since the second partner got at least as many right answers.  So they each earned .15 cents for each one they got right.
1900,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that they should each get some bonus. The person who answered more should get a little more than the person that answered less correctly. This makes it more even for the quality of work they did.
1901,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was still an amount X performed better than other participants
1902,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured $1.10 is enough to help X but not take too much away from Y.
1903,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems unfair that the first participant would get nothing for their time when they performed fairly well overall.  I went with half of what they would have gotten (0.15x10 questions) had they beat the second participant since they did complete fewer questions
1904,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't really know why, I just wanted it to be 0."
1905,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules were given and Y solved more problems and therefore, should get what the entire amount.  X knew the rules."
1906,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They still participated and solved problems, even though it is fewer than the other participant"
1907,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't like the thought of redistribution
1908,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  split it halfway so both participants get a share of the reward
1909,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of Ys earnings because both participants agreed to clear, fair rules before starting the task. Participant Y solved more problems and fairly earned the reward."
1910,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  You get what you worked for going by the rules.
1911,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   who solved more problems got
1912,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y deserved his bonus, but I thought it would be nice if Participant X got something for his/her participation."
1913,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Rules seemed fair
1914,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That participant didnt get enough for the money
1915,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel they deserved something for at least solving 8 so I gave them the lowest amount mentioned.
1917,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think it's fair that the participant who solved fewer problems receives no payment.
1918,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It did not feel good leaving the participant with no money when they did only 1 problem less, but I did not want to take too much away from the other participant either."
1919,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They made an effort, therefore I donated X 50 cents because It felt unfair to receive nothing. It felt fair because Y still received the most of it."
1920,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For effort alone
1921,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who answered less correctly still put forth time and effort for the task. They also missed the mark to be 'first' or 'best' by a few questions; it would be different if they had answered more questions incorrectly.
1922,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The directions were given clearly to each participant prior to participation. They knew the outcomes of their decisions could be what they were
1924,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The task was clearly laid out, and participant Y did much better"
1925,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  60 cents for 6 problems
1926,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  seems unfair that part x gets nothing being in the higher % of correct # of puzzles solved.
1928,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i considered that at least participant x got some answers write and just to determine fair distribution and to consider the efforts he put on calculating
1929,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participation should always be paid for, but it's fair to allow greater pay for better performance."
1930,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was only a 6 point difference in the number of questions answered correctly so the person who got nothing should get something
1931,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give them each equal money for what they completed
1932,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't believe participant X deserved more.
1933,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe the smarter person should keep all of their money since they solved many more problems than the other participant.
1934,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  if im doing this i want the compensation
1935,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like each participant put in an effort
1936,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the other player won fair and square and shouldn't have to share. Those were the rules that each agreed upon before playing the game.

1942,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt its like participation reward. Person X tried and should at least get something for the attempt
1943,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Everyone knew the rules of the game beforehand.  I hate people who want to make up to rules as they go because something is inconvenient for them.  Do better next time, or don't play."
1944,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the participants agreed to the distribution and should live with it without outside interference.
1945,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think participants should be penalized and robbed of their earnings. But one answered some while answered more. So give them just a little bit.
1946,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both participated and solved problems.
1947,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems unfair for one to get nothing when they both were correct about the same number of times.
1948,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules were that the participant would be paid .15 for each correct answer if they answered correctly at least as much as the other participant.  X answered 9 correctly y answered 21.  21 x .15 equals 3.15 which goes to Y.  X answered less questions  correctly than Y therefore they get 0.
1949,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He should be compesated for atleast doing 18 tasks
1950,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X also put some effort
1951,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's more reflective on contribution, as opposed to winner-take-all."
1952,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X made an effort so should earn at least a little something
1953,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  its fair considering the problems solved.
1954,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X won the game fair and SQAURE, why should they have to give up their money"
1956,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because Y perform better and should be rewarded better than X.
1958,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fair to give the participant some payout because they did solve problems.
1959,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to redistribute $1.00 to balance fairness and merit rewarding Ys better performance while still recognizing Xs effort.
1961,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the effort that participant X put into the task should be rewarded. I would related it to a job where a high performer should get  higher bonus that an average performer but the average performer should still be rewarded
1962,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of participant Ys earnings to participant X because the rules were clearly defined and accepted by both parties before the task. The incentive was based on relative performance, and participant Y fairly earned their reward by solving more problems than participant X. Redistributing earnings after the fact would compromise the fairness and integrity of the original agreement. Upholding the established rules ensures that effort and performance are respected and that the incentive system remains meaningful. While X made an effort, rewarding Y fully aligns with the studys merit-based structure and preserves its intended purpose."
1963,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clearly explained beforehand: only those who solved at least as many problems as their partner would earn money. Participant Y outperformed X, so its fair they keep their full earnings."

1965,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought Y still deserved more but X should get something as they only completed 3 less then Y.
1966,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The first participant also answered many questions correctly.
1967,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  A little for their effort but not enough to remove from the one that put in full effort.
1970,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of the game stated that whoever got more answers correct would get the money. The person who got most answers correct should have gotten all of the money.
1971,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I determined that Participant X had scored 3/5 of the questions that Participant Y had. I thought .75 would make it the most fair...that would give Participant X about 1/3 of the money earned.
1972,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i had no motivation
1973,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would be a bit hard to distribute such a small amount
1974,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were close but still didnt win.
1975,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y scored better and deserved to be paid. They were the better of the 2
1976,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I merely just wanted to share
1977,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Rules were determined in the beginning.  I should not be allowed to change them
1978,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions where clear about the payout, but each participant fell within the first standard deviation."
1979,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x did half as many questions however I do believe they deserve some kind of compensation just not as much as person Y
1980,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER EARNEDMORE
1981,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was a close race
1982,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I roughly estimated that fifteen is about two thirds of 23 and determined (roughly in my mind) that two dollars is an equitable amount for the work of doing 15. At first I made sure that the participant that scored fewer tasks had not done zero, so they deserve something since they contributed a fair amount."
1983,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The results were so close that it seemed appropriate for participant X to receive an amount close to what participant Y received.
1984,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant deserved it.
1985,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They performed similarly but one still did better so I did an almost even split still favoring the participant that performed better
1986,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is not fair to take much from the winner who solved many problems but also the othe person X deserves abit for solving the 8 problems solved.
1987,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Player X did not do that much worse than Player Y, and I thought they still deserved some compensation for their work."
1988,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although one participant answered one more question than the other, they both deserve recognition in the form of a payout. If the numbers of correct answers were further apart then I would have given way less."
1989,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not like redistribution.
1990,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were still able to recognize a small sector of the pattern recognition problems
1991,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that for taking part in the study they should get some compensation. But as they completed just over half of the other person I dont believe they earn 1/4 of what the other participant had made. Therefore, I gave them just over 1/4 of what the other participant earned feeling that it was a sweet one split now"
1992,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel the participant deserved something
1993,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though X solved fewer problems, it's a bit rough that they get nothing while Y gets a good chunk of change. The way the rules were set up, it's all or nothing, and that can feel pretty unfair, especially when the gap isn't huge. It feels right to share a little bit to make it less harsh for X, especially since Y still did really well and would still have a lot left."
1994,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that participant X should receive some compensation for their time and effort since they did solve many of the questions.
1996,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Giving participant X a small part of Y's earning shows empathy, even though X did not meet the criteria , but attempt was made"
1998,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant had done about half the amount of correct answers.
1999,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They agreed to the rules upfront.  Y earned it by doing more work, so I don't think it's fair to take anything away."
2000,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  20 correct problem solution distributed over $2.00 = $0.10 per solution - X had 5 gets $0.50 and Y gets $1.50 for there 15 + a $0.25 bonus for get more correct as an incentive - Hope this helps - G
2001,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If they went in to it knowing theyd get 0 for answering less I dont see why we should change that
2002,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that participant X should get some compensation as they answered 9 questions. They did not answer as many as participant Y though, so they should not get as much as that participant."

2004,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  im not sure what to put but they should get some i believe.
2006,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It feels unfair to have one person get nothing. I feel it's fair to give the participant with the lower score a small portion of the money.

2008,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned that
2009,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that we should stick to the original rules.  Other actions would seem to be much more arbitrary and unfair to the participants.
2010,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They rightly earned the money.
2012,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well I went with the rules that the participant that answered more questions would get the pay.
2013,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like X should have at least a little from Y. I decided on 0.95 because I feel like the majority should stay with Y.
2014,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant x solved fewer equations than participant Y
2015,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is because X also deserves to get something of substance. Kindness really motivated my decision.
2016,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that in my assigned position, I should abide by the original rules set forth and not manipulate them with my personal sympathy."

2021,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y worked very hard to earn their score and answer as many questions as they could. I feel it would be unfair to punish person Y for good performance.

2024,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told before agreeing to participate that there would be a chance that they'd be paid nothing if they did not solve as many problems as the other participant.

2028,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If that was the deal going into the study, then that deal should be honored. I am not taking money away from someone who did better at the task."
2029,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they were a pair working together. therefore they should share with the winner taking a slightly larger share.

2031,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Not sure ow the other person will do. Or myself for that fact.
2032,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did solve at least 10 problems, so I thought 10 cents for each problem solved."
2033,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   and solve more problems.
2035,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not view it as fair that participant X got zero even though they competed 14 tasks.
2036,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment.

2039,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think X should be given some for trying but not half, so I gave less than half."
2040,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not fair to pay someone nothing at all for doing work. So I gave the lesser cent amount to player X and left Y with 2.00 since they won. People who do work  expect to be paid something and if you do not pay them you are shady period.
2042,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  These two participants had nearly the same number of correct answers.  Therefore I feel that participant X should get some compensation.

2050,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X knew the risk involved, since they were aware that if they did not solve at least as many problems as participant Y, there would be no reward."
2051,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  12 is close enough to 17 to be significant, but at the same time,  I didn't want to diminish Y's performance."
2052,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant in blue solved more puzzles so he should make more money depending on if he got more answers right.
2053,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Give X a second chance to make money

2056,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think an all-or-nothing pay scheme is fair, but I also want to pay more to the higher performer."
2057,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  just to be fair and reward participation
2058,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the person underperformed and were informed in the beginning that they would not receive anything for underperforming the other participant. i did however award 0.05 for participation
2059,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X did some work so I feel like they deserve at least a little bit of bonus that Y got
2060,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although participant 1 only had 8 correct answers, they still contributed to the total solved."
2061,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both done the same task one may not have got as many right as the other but that doesnt mean they didnt work just as hard to do it.
2062,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   anything by the person who did better.
2063,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X solved almost as many problems as Y and should have received a close a mount to that Y received rather than 0 which was completely unfair for X
2064,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I find the conditions unfair so i gave them some but not the majority of the money
2065,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  need the cash
2066,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that since it was explicitly stated that the participant would only earn a bonus if they answered as many or more questions as the other, and this did not occur, it would be unjust to re-balance the bonus payouts."
2067,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant Y fairly earned what they earned.
2068,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it was fair to give some, or half, at least."
2069,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  fairness and effort recognition  proportionality  20% balances compassion with meritocracy  Behavioral Incentives, avoids discouraging future participants"

2071,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person deserves some money too.
2072,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more than double what X did. I think they deserve what they earned, there should not be any splitting of the earnings."
2074,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  y earned all their money
2075,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were told the rules.  Why change them

2079,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I had none it wouldn't let me put in the amount i wanted it would on let me enter 0 to go forward  i would have given .75
2080,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x did not earn it according to the initial rules, sorry"
2082,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's giving something to them and it's making an even amount to the other so they're both walking away with something
2083,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were aware at the beginning what the stakes were.  It is unfair to redistribute the earnings.
2084,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believed it was only fair that both participants get it roughly evenly split
2085,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like they both had scores that were similar to each other so that it's only fair to share the wealth. No one should walk away with nothing.
2086,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants understood going into the program that if they scored less than the other person, they would receive nothing.  The participant getting nothing will know they scored less.  No participation trophies for you, buddy."
2087,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both should get something
2089,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose this amount because person x completed about half as many questions as person y.
2090,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person didnt seem like they were not working, just worked a little slow and does deserve some benefit for that"
2091,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not my place to redistribute the participants earnings. Just didn't feel comfortable doing so.
2092,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought they probably deserved some, but half was very hard to figure out!"
2093,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just love to think about myself first.
2094,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I saw this as a team effort since they were paired up and hopefully collaborated appropriately
2095,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Mainly because Participant X did manage to solve 12 questions.
2096,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I distributed 0.05 to participant x because he tried and solved 4 problems correctly.
2097,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X deserves something for participating.
2098,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fair for them to earn one-third of the distribution considering they answered only 3 questions less correctly, 70% compared to the winner."
2099,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While X did perform below the average of the group, that person wasn't far away from the mean and did put forth some effort to get those results.  A small consolation is reasonable here."
2100,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The original  rules seemed fair, I felt  it would be unfair to give any of a participants earned bonus to someone else who did not  earn it."
2101,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though Y got more answers correct, X also did well and should receive some compensation."
2102,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Why award any money to the person that didnt earn it. Im sure he tried his best but that wasnt good enough to get a bonus.
2103,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I strongly believe Participant X deserves some reward for the effort contributed.
2104,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participants were told how much money they'd make and how to get it before starting the test. I believe they were rewarded appropriately based off the instructions and their performance.
2105,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They simply lost the competition, and didn't solve as many problems"
2106,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Be because X tried. So I thought they deserve at least a little of the money.
2107,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Fairness.
2108,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it would be fair to distribute a portion of the earnings, since the lower-performing person still put effort into the task, even though they only answered half the questions that the other person answered."
2109,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe it was only fair to distribute based on both participants' efforts.
2110,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think person x deserves a part
2111,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  In the beginning, both participants were told that if they didn't solve as many puzzles as the other, they would receive nothing. It looks to me, like the most fair thing is to keep that guideline. Participant Y earned the money. Participant x did not."
2112,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it was a fair amount to give to x since they did put in hours also
2114,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to X to receive something because they did solve 9 problems. It shouldn't be an all or nothing.
2115,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the first participant also made an effort.
2116,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The performance gap was very small, and both participants were among the top performers."
2117,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They signed up for the study, knowing that they were going to get nothing if they solved less problems than the other participant."
2118,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was motivated by this decision because I felt it was more fair to give both participants extra reward for their time.
2119,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was written in the directions, even though the effort, time etc for the other participant shouldve been rewarded in my view."
2120,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I had no reason to take what they earned.
2121,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They performed much worse than the red bar. They should not earn as much as red, but did deserve some payment based on getting some questions correct. The $1 amount paid is quite generous based on performance"
2122,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt as though given the work they did they should get an appropriate proportion of the reward.
2123,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  dude must not be all that bright, which is a hardship he has to live with, and one should not exploit his stupidity, unless he causes harm to others."
2124,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  You get what you earned
2125,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They earned their bonus fair and square
2126,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The study described how the outcome would be applied.
2127,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While I'm not against the losing participant receiving some reward, it seems unfair to take away from the winning participant, especially since the participants were told of the rules at the beginning of the game."
2128,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they only answered two questions less. it seems like they tried to work hard on the problems
2129,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other person still did tasks so I wanted to give them at least a little bit of something.
2130,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since they both were close in answers correct, I redistributed to be more fair. Blue got more right than red, so they got more."
2132,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that participation in a work activity should be paid at least a small amount and thought the 2 participants were advised in advance that an adjustment might take place so some adjustment is fair
2133,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i gave them almost half as they solved nearly as many questions as the other participant
2134,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think either way in the it all works out. I'm a giver not a taker. But I'll take and give away
2135,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would award 0.10 only, and keep in mind , thats being generous.  I think the participant that provided the correct answers should be awarded the amount deserved."
2136,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X still did the work and deserves a little reward, even if Y did far better."
2137,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For starters.  I want to see how things go.
2138,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clear and x lost the competition
2139,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told how they could earn a bonus and my decision directly reflects that explanation. I just followed the rules of the game because that is what the participants were expecting.
2140,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved one less problem so should get nearly half of the earnings.
2141,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  money was given based on performance
2142,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X still solved enough problems to justify them earning something, and person Y didn't solve so many more than X that they deserved all the reward."
2143,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did better, so they earned the money. X knew the rules but scored lower. It's fair to keep it all."
2144,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give participant X $1.50 from participant Y's earnings because I wanted to acknowledge participant X's effort and provide some support, while still recognizing the significant performance difference between the two participants. This amount seems like a fair balance"
2145,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y performed fewer tasks and following the directions of the activity would earn $0.00. Just keep to the 'rules' set by the surveyors.
2146,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant Y was more determined to complete as many as possible. From the data I believe Participant X was less driven to succeed.
2147,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would like both participants to receive equal payout
2149,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think people should receive what they earn
2150,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned that money fair and square. They completed more than double the amount of problems as Participant X. They deserve to be paid accordingly and taking money from them feels wrong.
2151,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to reward them for their efforts but not take much away from the other participant.
2152,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I made that decision because I wanted a fair redistribution, I made sure Y earned more while X gets a substantial reward for coming very close."
2153,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that because person y got more correct they should earn the reward. Maybe person y payed more attention or took more time.
2154,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participated knowing the rules.  I see no reason to change the rules which is in effect what redistribution of the earnings would do
2155,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of participant Y's earnings to participant X because the rules of the task were clear and agreed upon in advance. Both participants understood that earnings depended on relative performance: the one who solved more problems would be rewarded, while the one who solved fewer would receive nothing.    Allowing participant Y to keep their full earnings respects the merit-based structure and reinforces the idea that effort and performance are fairly rewarded. Redistributing earnings after the fact would undermine the credibility of the rules and could discourage future participants from striving to do their best, knowing outcomes might later be adjusted regardless of performance."
2156,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y has answered more questions correctly and he deserves his money. Why he should share it with participant X?
2157,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think since the other participant at least tried their best to complete the task that they should get part of the earnings.
2158,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered a small amount of questions so i gave them a small amount
2160,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  One participant may have had the opportunity for more questions than the other
2161,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought is was a more fair distribution of funds based on the productivity of the participants.
2162,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think both participants put in a similar effort and both deserve compensation. I wouldn't mind splitting the money with somebody I defeated in the study. People need to look out for each other even when it's not seen.
2163,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Obviously Y was the better problem solver but X did try and deserves somethng. I gave only .30 for trying.
2164,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told from the start that they would not get a bonus if they solved fewer puzzles than their partner.  There is no reason to change that rule after the fact.
2165,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well...I calculated six answers times 15 cents. The problem I see here is you are penalizing someone for being bad at math. Say Jim and Joan both had a factory job making ten bucks an hour and Joan was faster at making gigabobs and turned out 20 and hour when Jim was only able to turn out 15 despite working hard. Would you say, sorry Jim, you're not getting paid anything at all? This seems deeply unfair to me just as it seems deeply unfair that someone was pitted against a person who is better at problem solving and got nothing despite their best efforts. Of course I am assuming they gave it best efforts, they might have been slacking, but that's a whole 'nother issue."
2166,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clear that they would only get a bonus if they solved at least as many as the other participant. I see no reason to change that.
2167,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt the participant who answered less questions correctly should get a little bonus for participating.
2168,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although the participants accepted they might not be paid anything, it's nice to receive a little something. The disparity between the two solved amounts wasn't terrible. I thought a small compensation for it seemed fair enough."
2170,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did almost the same so I wanted to split the earnings.
2171,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Only the person with the most right answer was to receive the money for correct answers
2172,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Rounding, and because I thought it was unfair to receive nothing"
2173,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It stated it would pay .15 per answer, thus .15 X 4"
2175,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two were close in completing the same number of tasks. I feel the one who did the most gets the bulk of the reward but the one who came in second should get at least some credit.
2176,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since Participant Y completed more than twice as many puzzles, I dont feel as if Participant X deserves any of the monetary reward."
2177,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just because one participant knew more than the other doesn't mean one should be paid more than the other.  Both spent their time trying to solve the problems; so, they both should be paid equally for their time."
2178,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that participant y was rewarded for doing a better job than participant x, so they should get to keep their earnings."
2179,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be fair based on the amount of work they did.
2180,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason I decided to reallocate the earnings and give X $1.15 of Y's earnings is because I feel that the numerical value between how much Y got over X is too close in proximity to exclude X from getting anything. I didn't feel a technicality should ascertain X getting nothing over Y getting all and therefore felt that due to the effort and the close range in the number of questions each got right that it would be fair to compensate X as well.
2181,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both worked and desrve pay
2183,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because he still got quite a bit right, and was only 2 behind so in my opinion he should get a bit"
2184,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of Participant Ys earnings because the task was based on individual performance. Participant Y solved more problems and, therefore, met the criteria to earn the reward, while Participant X did not. To maintain fairness and uphold the merit-based incentive structure of the task, I believe it is appropriate that Participant Y keeps the full amount earned."
2185,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just split it halfway, that way they each still have something"
2186,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This person did solve a few puzzles and thus, should be award a small token reward"
2187,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't want to influence/over ride the results of the first phase.
2188,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved more problems than X.
2189,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules stated if you answer less questions correctly then you receive no funds
2190,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I aimed for a distribution that recognized both participation and high achievement without negating either.
2191,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that X should get something for the time and effort put in
2192,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To maximize payout for X and Y
2193,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The fact that Y got almost twice as many right as X was my primary driver. Because Y did better did not mean they should have to redistribute their earnings at all.
2194,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Despite them not answering as many questions, I think they still deserved a small amount of compensation for their time, as their results were pretty close."
2195,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like the person that answered more questions put in more effort
2196,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just went by following the rules of the study and what was told to them. It said that whoever solved more problems gets the money and that was Y. So I'm not changing the rules.
2197,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt .50 was enough of a bonus so they felt like they got something. Bit didn't take too much from the other participant.
2198,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like participant X should get a small amount for completing the activity. Even though they knew they would get nothing if they completed fewer problems, I think it's fair to give them a token amount."
2199,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that at least they tried by answering ten questions even if they did not get as many as the others
2200,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one solved almost twice as many as the other and so i felt deserved higher payment. Though neither deserved nothing.
2201,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I mainly chose to cut the cents from Participant Y on a whim. A piece of me also feels X should be rewarded for their efforts.
2202,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X likely worked just as hard as Y and still got plenty of answers right. I think X deserves something
2203,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That person did less than 25% of the work done by the other - they deserve nothing - just like the instructions noted.
2204,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was said that if the participant solved fewer problems than the other participant, the participant who solved fewer problems would't get rewarded"
2205,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were a team
2206,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both agreed to the rules upfront (whoever sold fewer problems would get nothing). Y did better and earned the reward fair and square. It is about what is agreed upon and respecting effort.
2207,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They seemed to be fairly proficient and even though they got one less right, they should get some bonus.  I felt that rounding the 2.55 to 2.00 and sharing the .55 seemed to be fair."
2208,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that participant Y solved more questions so they shouldn't share money with the other participant.
2209,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i gave that kind of money because of the effort participant x put in the work
2210,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It felt like a fair amount for the amount solved, but not taking too much from the one who solved more."
2211,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I simply gave a small percentage to the other participant.  I gave an amount that allowed me to retain the majority of the earnings while sharing a little with a candidate who had nothing at all.
2212,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't see any reason to redistribute funds that were earned according to a protocol understood by both parties.
2214,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I like the fact of splitting the money
2215,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y earned their rewards themself same as participant X
2216,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They knew how the payment would work before they did the task, so there is no reason to change it now."
2217,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules as to how the participants would be paid was clear. Each participant took part with using their own free will. Why give back to X, when that individual knew the consequences if they answered fewer questions than Y. If there are other circumstances that we should be aware of that would justify a redistribution, we should be made aware of them."
2218,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although person X did not get as many as person Y, I feel that person X at least tried their best and should be compensated even a little. Person Y clearly just knew more than person X which may be an unfair advantage."
2219,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules are known going in and the participants by engaging in the challenge accepted them .  I see no reason to redistribute against the general rules.
2220,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X scored approximately 75% of what Y was able to accomplish, so I feel X deserved approximately 25% of the total available payout."
2222,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x did solve a good % of the questions
2223,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I choose 0 because they did not earn any money
2224,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that both participants should be compensated but the participant who scored higher should receive a higher reward.
2225,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to redistribute $1.20 from participant Y to participate X was motivated by a desire to reduce the significant earnings disparity and acknowledge the effort both participant put into the task
2226,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because I couldn't give more
2227,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give the other participant at least something, since they still seemed to try their best by answering 7."
2228,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since X answered almost the same amount of questions as Y, a portion should go to X.  About half."
2229,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that some benefit should flow back to the person X while person Y retains the majority of the payout for high performance.
2230,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x answered less questions
2231,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did not earn the bonus.  Y should not be responsible nor penalized for X's performance
2232,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should get some earnings too.
2233,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told that if they answered fewer questions than their partner, they would not be paid anything.  They knew going into the task the risks."
2234,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the other participant should earn at least a little something. I decided to give the cents of the participant Y's earnings to X. Participant Y will get a solid number and X will get at least something.
2235,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was simply based upon compensating participants for their time.
2236,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  
2237,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't feel like it's fair for X to not get paid at all since they did solve 13 problems, but since this was a competition for most problems solved and Y won, and win by a big margin, I also don't think it's fair to take too much of Y's winnings. So, I awarded 10% to X as a consolation prize."
2238,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X got some problems correct as well, just fewer than Y. there shouldn't be all-or-nothing rewards."
2239,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not want to be the reason why someone earns nothing
2240,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clear that if you solved fewer problems you would not receive any compensation.
2241,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant X has half of Y
2242,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just took 13 correct divided by 16 correct and then multiplied that times the$2.40
2243,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although the participants were told at the beginning of the study that they would receive a bonus only if they answered more questions correctly than the other person, I believe in equality. I am convinced that the reason for the majority of society's ills is an extreme balance in resources among people, ie. wealth inequality. While this is only a small amount, I feel that participant X tried to the best of their ability, was right in the average of where most people landed (15 correct questions) and therefore should receive some type of bonus. Participant Y still gets $2.49, X gets $1.00 and everyone should be happier than if Y got all the money."
2244,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules about how to earn the bonus were communicated ahead of time, so it seems fair to reward the bonus according to the rules and not make any changes."
2245,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not think it would be fair to change the rules and redistribute money between players X and Y.
2246,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would like to create an environment in this situation where both participants are paid equally for this study so that they both have an equal chance to manage the money in the most efficient way possible to grow it whether that be spending, investing or saving."
2248,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although they got fewer correct they still participated
2250,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did not earn any money, so why should Participant Y give up his."
2251,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants willingly took part in a study that rewarded the one that was better performing.  I do not feel that it is fair to alter or redistribute the earnings.
2252,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X did not earn it. Simple as that.
2253,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y won so they should clearly get more.  X worked hard and achieved a great number so they deserve some compensation.
2254,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  AN UNEXPECTED TOKEN PAYMENT AS A THANK YOU . BUILDS GOOD WILL AND MAKES FUTURE PARTICIPATION MORE LIKELY.
2255,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants solved nearly-even amount of solutions. Since participant Y did do one more solution, the distribution is slightly weighted towards them for effort, but X did deserve close to half of the earnings."
2256,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to split it 50/50 but decided that one participant did answer more correctly and should be paid a little bit more.
2257,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the participants should have been told that the money could be redistributed in any manner. That being said The first participant should earn something for their time.
2259,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that figure will be enough
2260,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since they had similar correct responses, and more correct responses than most of the other participants, I think it would be fair to get the other participant almost half of the others' earnings."
2261,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved more problems and therefore should earn more
2262,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X performed poorly, but Y didn't do particularly well either. It is unfair to compare Y to X and not the entire distribution."
2263,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should both be paid proportionately for answering questions correctly.
2265,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved more problems and earned the reward. X didnt meet the threshold. Thats the game they signed up for.
2266,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The terms were clearly stated making it fair.
2267,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the rules at the beginning of their study clearly said that if the other participant completed more puzzles then the payout would be 0
2268,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  20 cents for their effort
2269,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants accomplished similar amount of work. Therefore, both participants should be paid fairly."
2270,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The original description said that the participant would get 0 if they didn't answer as many questions as the other participant. Participant Y won and answered more questions so I don't think participant x should get anything.
2271,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved only one less problem than Participant Y, so a 50% split of the earnings felt most equitable."
2272,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants should get something for their effort, but their performance should also be considered.  My decision seemed like a good compromise between the two."
2273,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X did just under half of the questions as Person Y, so they should have just under half of the reward."
2274,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants were informed of the way payment would be determined at the start of the task.
2275,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Solved 11 problems wasnt that bad, its just 1 problem difference"
2276,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should receive a small reward for the problems that they answered correctly.
2277,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just because the solved less problems doesn't mean they should be penalized.
2278,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   more. But both obviously tried so I thought both should have something.
2279,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant should receive something but only proportional to how well they performed
2280,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Right now I have nothing and neither does the other participant. Why not split the money so we both leave this study better off than when we started?
2281,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even tho X  answered fewer problems correctly there was an effort made on Xs behalf and he should be able to receive some compensation for the effort he put forth
2282,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That seems like a fair amount. Participant X should receive some compensation for their problem solving.
2284,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were explained in the beginning.
2285,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were known up front, they should be followed."
2287,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that this participate did has much as the other
2288,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was motivated by the thought process that an individual should be paid for their hard work and should not have any of their earnings split with someone who they performed better than.
2289,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y only correctly answered one more answer than Participant X so I based my decision on trying to evenly distribute the earnings.
2291,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that since this is a task that both parties worked on, both parties should have some sort of benefit.  However the person who did better in the task should get more funds distributed."
2292,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did contribute somewhat to the study. Therefore I feel that they should receive some compensation.
2293,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  simple math
2294,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Going into the study the participants knew the distribution of money based on their work.  There is no reason to reward the individual who answered less questions with some of the money that the individual who answered more questions earned.
2295,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like X participated and should get something, not more than Y but at least something."
2296,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Though I believe in pay for performance, I do also feel that A deserves a base line payment for participation."
2297,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   and redistribute his/her earnings that they deservedly earned. That just doesn't seem fair.
2298,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They performed similarly but Y solved more correctly than X.
2299,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There is no reason to redistribute. Both parties get what they earned.
2300,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were told the instructions and knew what they were agreeing too.  I stuck to the guidelines.
2301,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did complete some of the problems and did contribute to the results and since there was compensation, they should have received something for their effort. UNLESS they were told they would not receive anything unless they answered more questions correctly."
2302,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   but the other participant should receive a pittance at least for taking time to participate.
2303,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think both players should receive some pay and the winner receiving double the amount of the loser here seems fair.
2304,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just like sharing
2305,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think there was not much difference between A and B so they should share the bonus.
2306,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted X to have some money to because they still completed 12 problems. I want Y to have more because he completed 19.
2307,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based on the graph
2308,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I'm sure that X did the very best they could...maybe nervousness affected their performance.  Although they really did not do as well, it doesn't seem fair that they get nothing at all for their efforts."
2309,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To be supportive of my fellow teammate for participating.
2310,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x didnt earn the money according to the survey so they shouldnt get any.
2311,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like since participant X did try to solve a decent amount they should get at least some money for it. It sucks it has to come from the other participants but it's a bit fair for the most part.
2312,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's the fairest thing to do. The person did solve some problems
2313,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the more who produced more should get more
2314,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the difference in correct answers was small, I believe the rewards should be more comparable although the winner should receive more than the loser."
2315,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The ratio would allow some effort to be rewarded for X.
2316,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y clearly deserved more for solving more, but Person X did pretty well.  I did not want to penalize Y for the sake of X so tried to be fair and go with what I would have felt comfortable doing myself."
2317,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is at least a consolation prize for trying to beat the other opponent
2319,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since the participant Y participated in it, He should also be awarded"
2320,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's not fair to decrease someone else's earnings due to the other person not doing as well.
2321,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  equality
2322,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they participated well, but not as good at the other participant"
2323,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  People deserve what they earn for their hard work. Because of the large discrepancy, I believe that the person that scored higher deserves the full amount."
2324,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like they got a lot of problems right so even though they did less, I felt they should be rewarded."
2325,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of the decisions were clearly stated at the begining  Changing the rules after the fact is inappropriate.
2326,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should get a least something for trying
2328,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well participant x was only behind by 3 (X got 15 and Y got 18), so that shows that X also put effort into the task. So I split the amount in half and got 1.35 each."
2329,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While the participant who solved 11 problems didn't perform as well as the participant with whom they were matched, they still solved a significant number of problems. Redirecting 20% of the earnings to them doesn't significantly alter the reward of the person who solved 17 problems while still rewarding the other person's effort."
2330,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X tried
2331,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did not get even one wrong, I am thinking that they did not really try and therefore does not deserve any of the reward money."
2332,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person did get some questions correct so I gave them a small bonus.
2333,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it would be fair to atleast give participant X a small compensation for even agreeing to participate
2334,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant y did the work and deserves what they earned. It sucks x tried and got nothing but y shouldnt be punished for that.
2335,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The total shouldn't just go to one participant.  Spread it around to make it more fair.
2336,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do believe the person who answered more questions should get paid more, but I also do believe that the other person should be money for participating and for their time."
2337,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X may have solved fewer problems, thereby not earning as much as Participant Y. However, Participant X did put forth effort in participating in the study. So Participant X should be rewarded for that."
2338,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Before starting the task, both participants were informed of the rules: earn $0.15 per correct answer only if you solve as many or more problems than your paired participant. They accepted this condition willingly. Participant X, having solved fewer problems, did not meet the earning condition."
2339,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was so close that I didn't think it was really fair that participant X got nothing.
2340,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were presented with 24 problems and neither completed all of them. One participant solved over half and the other less than half. However, given that one outperformed the other only slightly, I feel it only fair to distribute it in a similar fashion."
2341,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I'm really not sure.  I felt this was a fair distribution
2342,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that participant X did solve a fair amount of problems, and the fact they earned nothing because they were one correct answer short of meeting participant Y's correct answers doesn't feel entirely fair to me. I decided to give them a decent bonus, but I did not give them a majority of participant Y's earnings because that did not feel fair for participant Y."
2343,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because both subjects participated the same time and effort and not really fair to not receive anything for the task
2344,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  its good to share
2345,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like Participant X should get something for solving 7 problems and it should be less than what participant Y is getting but still should be something
2346,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 2 problems, while Participant Y solved 7, which is a substantial difference. Participant X did not meet the threshold to earn anything according to the original rules."
2347,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person may not have gotten as many answers correct, but they at least deserve an almost even amount of compensation for their time and efforts"
2348,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did better than Y so they deserved some payment but I didn't want to take all of X's payment. I thought splitting it in half was a fair enough compromise.
2349,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If they both did the word they should both get the reward
2350,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Empathy and fairness
2351,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were not far from the other side so they can get a small reward
2352,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think at the end of the day 2.25 bonus amount is generous, but for someone to be a runner up and get nothing for just getting one more single problem wrong is a little disheartening. Therefore the person who got 15 right should get 1.25 and the person who got 14 should get 1 dollar."
2353,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should get a little bit but I don't think that they should get too much because they did not answer the most questions. I think that that would be too much of a reward and the other one wouldn't be rewarded as much and they're the ones that got it the most right
2354,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want participant X to also receive some money.
2355,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I based my decision on merit and on my current mood.
2356,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it should be shared equally.
2357,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was only a one question difference between the two participants so its not fair for Participant X to get nothing.
2358,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant did solve almost as many as I did.
2359,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i am honest
2360,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave Participant X $1.20 for the 8 they got correct at $0.15 each. It was a partner exercise, and each walks away with a little bit of cash. It's meant to be a fun exercise, and it's not really a life-changing amount of money, so why not share?"
2361,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Im sorry I do the studies so that I can be paid. Im not here to distribute earnings because prolific is a charity. The last time I checked.
2362,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y's performance was almost twice better than X's, it would be unfair to Y to redistribute."
2363,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I took the percentage of X solved and multiplied it by the amount Y received so they would get paid based on their right answers so it was worth both peoples time
2364,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved at least as many problems as Participant Y. It doesnt seem fair at all for them to have even done some work and received nothing.
2365,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Mainly because the person still got a lot right so deserves some compensation
2366,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My acknowledgement of efforts and competence , as shown in the chart and balancing reward for superiority with general fairness."
2367,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted each person to be paid approximately what they worked.
2368,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that more information was needed in order to distribute
2369,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The player that won should receive the full amount.
2370,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That would defeat the rules of the original task
2371,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X didn't meet the qualifications for bonuses that were clearly stated, so why should they share in Participant Y's earnings? They shouldn't."
2372,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  seems like the money was divided just as the participants said it would be
2373,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I simply chose me and what benefited me
2374,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though participant Y solved 1 more problem correctly, participant X solved only 1 less problem correctly."
2375,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant who solved a very large number is entitled to a greater prize.  The number that the other participant solved, which is around average, should be entitled to some compensation for their performance, but not as much as the high performer.  It shouldn't be all or nothing in my opinion."
2376,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Second place should get a price and the other participant was close to 15 answers.
2377,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned it by figuring out more problems, so there's no transfer."
2378,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  One participant earned it. The other did not. I shouldn't have to be shared.
2379,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they both did extremely well and deserve to get some compensation since it was only a difference of 1.
2380,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were established and communicated to participants x and y before they began the study. I did not see any reason to make an adjustment to the payout.
2381,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y solved more problems correctly and therefore I dont believe any of their money should go to the other participant
2382,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one that answered more questions is entitled to the payment. It is what motivated them.
2383,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did solve more problems than Participant X, but only a few more.  Participant should receive a reward for their time and effort, and the number of problems they solved."
2384,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 8 problems, so giving them some sort of reward while still giving most to participant Y seemed fair."
2385,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant with more answered questions did answer significantly more questions; however both participants put time and effort into the task and paying nothing for that would be unfair.
2386,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Make things as equal as possible
2387,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  How the amount is distributed seems somehiw unfair to me as
2388,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Thought that it would be more fair for the work done.
2389,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They already knew the rules going in, so I don't see a reason to go against it. Hence, no redistribution"
2390,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both of them answered almost the same number of correct answers, so I gave almost have to participant X"
2391,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the description participant x and y received clearly said that if you answered fewer questions correctly than the other participant, then you would receive nothing. Since participant x answered fewer questions correctly, I chose to stay with the determined payout in order to uphold the rules."
2392,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X at least tried to participate and made an effort but lost. It's only fair that X be compensated just for the effort and Y carries the bigger share
2393,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give the other side something as it seems wrong for them to get nothing. whereas the other side still receives a sizeable amount and everyone walk away with something.
2394,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just took a ratio of 14 / (14+22) or 38.8%.  It was a math decision as X had solved 38.8% correctly.
2395,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is only fair that the participant receive all the earnings that he worked for.
2396,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That one did well so I think deserved a bonus
2397,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants participated with very close finish.
2398,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I read the instructions carefully, and it was said that each participant was told and was aware of the rules. I.e. in order for one participant to get the money per correct question solved, they would at least have to match the success rate of the other participant. These were the terms agreed upon and fully known by each participant. Therefore, it seems unjust for me to retroactively take money away from one participant, if the rules were already agreed upon freely."
2399,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the original rules should apply.
2400,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe both participants put forth a great effort to solve as many problems as they could.
2401,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not see any reason to give money from the participant who answered more questions than the one who answered less
2402,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clear from the start that compensation would be based on merit so participant X should not expect anything.
2403,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If this was a survey through Prolific, you should have quoted an amount you would pay for participating. You don't mention that so just thought to give X at least a minimum amount for his effort."
2404,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did still get a fair amount right so I feel like they should have something for the work that she did
2407,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X  contributed and scored correctly on several problems
2408,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If participant X got paid 15 cents for the 12 questions they answered correctly, they would have made $1.80. I decided to compensate them half of this because it does take away from participant Y's earnings, and participant Y deserves to be paid what they earned, just as participant X does. It seems more fair for both of them to take an unfair hit to their earned income, but also for both to be compensated in some way. It shouldn't be a zero-sum-game where the winner takes all."
2409,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I assume that each player knew, and agreed to the terms of the task ahead of time. I don't know why the rules should change after the task is completed."
2410,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Not getting paid seems a bit harsh for missing some questions.
2411,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved less
2412,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel X worked just as hard as X and should be rewarded for their efforts.
2413,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just feel that the other participant should at least get a small reward for their efforts.
2414,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not feel a need to give the other participant anything.
2415,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel it would be unfair to Y if i upended the specific rules they were given in order to give money to X. i didn't come up with the study's rules, so i don't feel I have a right to mess them up."
2416,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were explained clearly and person y earned the money
2417,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Solving these type of problems is difficult.I think between seven and ten is close enough that it should have been split since they were working as a pair
2418,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is really a group assignment. The first participant was only off by one question so they were clearly active in the task and deserve a reward.
2419,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Everyone participated so Everyone should get something but the person that did best should get more
2421,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told at the very beginning how they would be paid.   There isn't any reason to redistribute the money when they knew the terms.
2422,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was just following what the original rules were.
2423,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who worked hardest won the competition
2425,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i gave half sharing is caring snd good karma
2426,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think there should be a conclusion where one gets paid and one doesn't.  People should be rewarded for effort.
2427,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am motivated by a sense of fairness and on the surface, the person who solved 13 of the questions deserves around half the money since this person put forth an effort presumably as much as the person who solved 18 questions.  Getting zero does not seem fair."
2428,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  just sounded logical
2429,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did more work should be paid more
2430,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X scored a little below Participant Y and according to the the instructions participant who scored lower would not get anything so i do not think it will be nice to give out from the other participant price.
2431,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because at least the participant tried
2432,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they should both get a reward since they both answered a good amount of pattern questions correctly.
2433,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Assuming that both participants spent the same amount of total time on the task and put forth the same effort, I'm not sure one should be rewarded more for performing faster. Some people just don't test as quickly as others and I'm generally a fan of quality over quantity. It's hard to determine this without more information, but my inclination given that most participants completed around 14-16 problems is to divide the money equally."
2434,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  there were desire to achieve goals
2435,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not believe it taking something away from another person, just because the other participant performed worse.  That is not right."
2436,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like 18 correct answers disserves something while still giving more to the participant with the most correct answers.
2437,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If this were a game show, X brought a spoon to a knife fight. The rules were clear, the stakes were known, and Y crushed it. You dont give a silver medal to someone who didnt cross the finish line just because they looked tired."
2438,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought participant X should be paid at least a small bonus for solving the problems they completed. As such, I took the bonus amount given to participant Y for each problem solved and divided it by 2 to split that amount between the participants. I then multiplied that number by the number of problems participant X solved to get $0.60 to be awarded to participant X."
2439,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X solved 7 problems, with person Y solving 11. Therefore, the funds seem more evenly distributed, with person Y receiving more, with the redistribution."
2440,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Assuming the winning participant won the previous round as well, then the other participant would leave with nothing if I didn't distribute. I believe in merit based earnings, not winner take all."
2441,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give the participant who solved less problems something, but not much of the other participant's earnings."
2442,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did solve some problems. We don't know why it wasn't as much as Y. Y could be smarter or have more knowledge.
2443,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was barely any difference between their two results. X shouldn't receive zero compensation solely based on that.
2444,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved only 2 more questions than X. If it was less than 5 I would give Y the full amount.
2446,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Such a gap in performance makes me wonder if one participant wasn't really making an effort. I chose to give them .50 just incase they did try.
2447,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X put in an effort more than half of what Y did
2448,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If it's a competition, and the rules were plainly stated, the winner should get the entire amount.  Why should the winner need to split what he/she won?"
2449,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The directions of the task were clear when they both participated and that is what they both earned, I'm not sure by what factors I can determine how to redistribute anything?"
2450,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There wasn't a significant enough amount to cause me to want to redistribute. Let the earner keep their earnings.
2451,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think both participants should receive some reward for their effort
2452,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I like to give
2453,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they didn't deserve it
2454,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to distribute 0.55 because participant X was only one question away from matching participant Y. I also felt bad that they weren't receiving any earnings.
2455,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants went into the process having been informed of how the payout process would work.  One participant solved more problems correctly than the other and earned the payout, I don't see any reason why I'd need to change that outcome."
2456,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just seemed fair since they were close
2458,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y scored in a higher percentile and answered more questions correctly. Participant Y deserves to keep the money they earned because those are the rules of the game
2459,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Most people would want to keep it for themselves so I did too.
2460,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X will receive $0.25 for the effort, while Y receives the Majority for a job well done. This approach in my view balances fairness and motivation, acknowledging effort and still rewarding higher achievement."
2461,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Its a fair deal that both parties agreed on.
2462,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y gets the majority for what they have rightly earned, and X still gets honored in this decision."
2463,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was following the rules that both parties consented to.
2464,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that that is a good amount to give as it seems average and not too small and not too large
2465,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants scores were reasonably close, but Y still solved a few more problems. I thought my distribution of the total earned was fair given the number of problems each person solved."
2466,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the difference between the two participants was 2. 2 x .15 is 0.30. 2.40 - .3 = 2.10. one half of 2.10 is 1.05. Therefore, the person who got 14 correct should get 1.05 and the person who got 16 correct should get 1.35."
2467,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  For easy distribution of funds
2468,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think this was a generous amount not knowing exactly what the results will be.
2469,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should get a little something just for participating, but didn't want to take too much away from Participant Y."
2470,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should be compensated for the amount of correct answers they made but only a third since Y answered more correctly
2471,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe both participants  should be rewarded for their work. but...participant y should receive a little more for getting more right
2472,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There were rules and player Y won fairly.
2473,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If I recall correctly one of the groups had to use a much larger key chart making it take much longer.
2474,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like participant Y worked harder to solve more problems and be more accurate.
2475,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that redistribution of earnings would go against the earlier agreement made. It is a harsh agreement, but it was entered into willfully."
2476,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  
2478,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both were in the higher performers, and I felt X deserved something. I split the amount of the two greeater answers of Y with Y and X, each got 0.15 for the two extra questions answered by Y."
2479,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just to keep fair for both
2480,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reason behind my decision is based on the performance of Y who should keep the majority of the earnings. By offering X a small gesture to recognize their efforts as 9 correct answers is not a trivial contribution. I think this decision reflects a balance between merit-based reward and compassion.
2481,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I redistributed part of the earnings so that the participant who scored higher still got $1 more than the participant who scored less, but so that the other participant was still rewarded for their efforts considering they only scored 2 points under the better performing participant."
2482,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to allocate 0 of Y's earnings because X completed less than Y in the same amount of time, which is what the participants were told at the beginning. Because there is no cost incurred to either participant for taking the 10 minutes to participate I see no reason to alter the amount paid to either participant, in other words there is no overhead each person is expected to make up by participating in the study."
2483,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems fair to distribute a small portion of y's earnings to x, assuming that they both did their best, and that y didn't cheat."
2484,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were really close in the number of problems solved so I thought leaving participant X with no earnings would be unfair. However, I left participant  Y with more earnings overall."
2485,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Solved almost as many problems so should receive something.
2486,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Im sure they both tried their hardest so they are both deserving of something. I think person Y will still be happy enough with 1.90, and person X will be really happy to have received 0.80 they were not expecting."
2487,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Yes
2488,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just want to share a bit for their work.
2489,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was explained that the payment would be this way. Those were the rules
2490,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This choice presented a balanced or favorable risk-to-reward ratio.
2491,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants answered questions, therefore both should earn some portion of the payout maybe not the same amount but they should still earn something."
2492,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did not solve as many problems as Y
2493,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants were very close in their answers.  Totally unfair that one wallks away with nothing, but it should not be half.  I think a dollar is a fair reward."
2495,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The question answered properly were close so the loser should gat some compensation.
2496,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Some people are just smarter than others, I do not think someone should be penalized for not knowing as much as the next person."
2497,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were already set and I believe the particinpants were aware of it. So for me I feel like the decision is final and the payout should remain as is.
2498,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I see that Y has solved more answers than x as shown in the graph so it would be unfair for them to get 0.00
2499,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules in a survey should be followed throughout the process.
2500,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  sharing is caring
2501,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  keep what you earn & don't give it away
2502,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by the fact that the other participant had nothing at all
2503,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just think it's fair. Participant X solved nearly as many problems as participant Y.
2504,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X completed a number of the puzzles successfully but was slightly below the average, while Participant Y completed more and was slightly above the average. I feel that it is fair to reward Participant X for their performance."
2505,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that participant Y need to be compensated too
2506,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  From what I gather, the rules state that a payment of 15 cents would be distributed between the participants for every correct answer if the participants answered about the same amount, or something like that. However, if a participant answers significantly fewer questions correctly, then they would receive no compensation. And participant X answered only 7 questions correctly, whilst participant Y correctly answered 17. Therefore, it wouldn't make sense to break the rules like that by giving participant X anything (although I did consider it because of the time and effort they put into the task). Even more than that, it wouldn't be fair if that money were to come out of the compensation meant for participant Y."
2507,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Blue in the end performed better so they should be paid accordingly. Should not have to redistribute.
2508,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think 14 points is not that much higher than 10, and the other participant likely put in honest effort and should be rewarded for it."
2509,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were both close enough.
2511,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I'd like to give them something.
2512,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate X only answered 1 less question than Y, therefore X should receive something for 2nd place"
2513,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that distributing money like that isn't equitable and doesn't result in positive consequences.
2514,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Earning is based on the answers the participants got right, and it wouldnt be fair to give X some of Y earning."
2515,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that sticking to the original agreed upon rules. Participate Y earned it.
2516,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Everyone should get a reasonable amount for their time investment, not based on performance alone."
2517,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just seemed like a nice small bonus for getting 8 questions even if it was fewer than the other participant
2518,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the rules of the game are that X will get nothing if Y gets more answers correct.
2519,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i think they deserved a little bit but not as much as the other
2520,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They only got half the answers right
2521,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted both participants to receive compensation. It just seemed fair.
2522,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it would be right to redistribute it in some way rather than have one participant win nothing  but it also  didnt seem fair to make it much higher than this.
2523,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should both receive something, and I decided on the amount by giving 1/2 of what the other person that did better would receive."
2525,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I redistributed a small portion of person y to x this preserves performance and fairness
2526,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  
2527,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the rules stated that you would get nothing if you answered less correctly
2528,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They solved more so they deserved their rewards.
2529,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I see no reason to distribute the earnings. They both earned what they earned. If I had a reason to distribute, I would."
2530,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the amount specified.
2531,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   after the game was played.
2532,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions said that the person with fewer correct answers would get nothing and the person with the most correct answers would get .15 per correct answer. Changing the bonus would not be right or moral.
2533,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned their bonus. However there is a discrepancy in how they performed with Y outperforming the average and X. However it is still an earned bonus.
2534,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I dont think its fair that participant X gets paid nothing when they still had to do the work of completing the 10 problems. If they did the work, they should be paid. Its not fair because some people are just naturally more intelligent than others. X should still be paid a little for the work."
2535,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant would consider sharing the bonus.
2536,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They only scored a single question less
2537,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rule says the Participant that solved fewer problems should earn 0.0 USD. Participant X solved fewer problem, hence should earn 0.0 USD."
2538,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  One participant clearly did much better but the other participant deserves at least a little bit for their effort
2539,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it's fair to give them something
2540,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want everyone to leave with a little something I think it's only fair.
2541,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I took 1.00 and gave it to the lower earner, leaving 1'69 for the higher earner.  Seemed fair."
2542,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There was only a difference of two solved problems between the two participants. Out of 17 total problems completed by subject Y (15 by X) I don't think the marginal difference should be penalized so heavily. Also, unless I'm mistaken, the number of completed tasks says nothing about how many questions were completed correctly."
2543,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Distribution based on a percentage of correct answers
2544,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  You told them the terms and they played by them. I'm not getting involved.
2545,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  According to what i read the one that did not answer at least the same amopun tof questions should get zero
2546,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Its only fair
2547,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules did state that it was winner take all. But in the interest of fairness I gave .50 to the loser.
2549,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y showed that they scored higher, earning their reward."
2551,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He didn't perform anywhere close to the other person's performance, so shouldn't get any bonus"
2552,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X performed fairly well and deserves at least something. I feel like 75 cents isnt too much to take away from Participant Y.
2553,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though the participants were told there would be an additional phase which might alter the money they receive, I feel they should get the reward as they were told."
2554,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think 1 USD is a pretty fair transfer based on how many problems Participant X solved. Participant Y still solved more, so they should keep the majority."
2555,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  While Participant X solved less than half of the problems Participant Y did, it seems unfair to not reward them any money at all."
2556,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both had an opportunity to solve the problems and knew the rules beforehand. Y was superior, 19-10 and has earned the pot."
2557,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The results were pretty close (8 v. 10), so just split the bonus between them."
2558,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that Participant X should receive some compensation for his/her time and effort. He/She should receive less though, because he/she solved 10 less problems than Participant Y."
2559,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel it is fair for both to get some compensation for their efforts.
2560,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based on the merit of participant X's performance when taken in context of the performance of all other participants, participant X would likely be a winner in many other matchups. While it is a small sum that I chose to allocate to participant X, I believe that they deserved more than nothing for their performance, although participant Y was deserving of their earnings as the victor in the competition. The amount was small because I believed that participant Y shouldn't have their earnings reduced by much."
2561,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it was already clarified to then at the beginning and not fair to anybody who didn't receive a break on the rules
2562,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participate won the challenge
2564,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  sharing is caring
2565,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That is what I would do if I was given the choice as being the participant that had one more answer correctly and my sense of fairness.
2566,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe they should get something for the answers they did get correct.
2567,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both people came into the process with knowledge of how they would be paid.
2568,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant y deserves compensation for being part of the study, so 30 cents seems like enough compensation compared to the $1.80 participant x will receive."
2569,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant y  did much better in answering with accuracy and earned the amount stated. Participant X knew the rules going into it and yet did poorly. X new that by answering fewer questions correctly that the amount earned would be $0.
2570,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give the other person some money even though they didn't get more problem right because they got 12 right which is still an accomplishment.
2571,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I need as much money as I can get in between jobs.
2572,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions said if they did not complete as many as the other then they would get nothing so it seems fair to give the person who completed vastly fewer problems nothing as they were already told this would happen
2573,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were explicit and thorough
2574,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because I think they should at least get some, but not all of what I get .just some"
2575,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't really have any
2576,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It really should be split up.  Both people did the survey so they should both be paid
2577,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just broke down the questions by 10 cents
2578,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Roughly half of the earnings seems fair and I don't want to be greedy.
2579,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that person Y worked hard for the money they earned and therefore deserve the money they earned for the work they performed. I don't think the money should be taken to give to x because it isn't right.
2580,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X still answered 6 questions, half of what Y did"
2581,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The players understood the instructions so the instructions should remain as presented.
2582,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I need the money
2583,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y solved more problems correctly so I believe they deserve the money.
2585,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did 9 problems and got 0. Y did 12 and got 1.79. That seemed unfair. I tried to make it more fair by giving .79 toX leaving 1.00. for Y.
2586,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think someone should get nothing for getting 9 correct, but I also don't think they should receive anything significant, so I chose .35 leaving Y with $1.60.  Both should be satisfied"
2587,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that participant X should get something.
2588,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't believe the red person, x, should receive nothing. I've awarded slightly more to the blue person for their effort."
2589,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants knew the rules when they started and still agreed to go through with the study, so I left the rules as is."
2590,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though participant x got less than participant y, they still did do something, so I think they should get some compensation."
2591,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am just being annoying
2592,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that this would be a fair amount for the number of correct answers that participant X gave. This way both X and Y get something.
2593,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  should be incentive to answer any question correctly, so each correct answer should be rewarding"
2594,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems a fair amount for the effort.
2595,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would like to be completely fair and give the other participant a deserving amount.
2596,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned the money fairly.
2597,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Generosity
2598,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want to stick to the original rules
2600,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did 9 questions with no earnings, I think it's fair to give them a small amount from Y"
2601,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants got a good number of questions right (9 & 12), so I felt like both participants should get something at least. If there was a bigger gap between the amount of correct answers, I would have just given it all to the person that got 12."
2602,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clear, if X didn't match or exceed Y's solve rate there would be no prize."
2603,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants were instructed as to the compensation for participating in the study. I don't see any reason for rewarding the participant who only solved 8 problems compared to 15 by the other one.
2604,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although by the rules participant X should receive 0 USD, I feel they deserve some compensation because they only solved one less problem that participant Y. I guess I'm leaning toward participation being rewarded, even if outside what is stipulated in the rules."
2605,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the participant X answered 18 questions, 1 less than Y and I think it's fair to be paid almost the same amount"
2606,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This small redistribution recognizes that both individuals participated and made an effort, while still strongly rewarding the much higher performance of participant Y. It strikes a modest balance between fairness and compassion"
2607,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Out of kindness and thought for participant x's time.
2608,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  for fairness and equity.
2609,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X put in a good amount of work just like participant Y did. The only difference is that participant Y completed 2 extra for a total of 17 compare to X's 15. So I decided to give them almost half while make sure that participant Y still had more than X because they completed more.
2610,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I am in need financially
2611,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just want to even things out.
2612,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  12 correct is not that bad
2613,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  person y won easily and deserves the money
2614,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did solve 9 problems and should receive something for their effort
2616,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They still got some of the questions correct and should be compensated for it
2617,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both participants should be paid off of how many correct answers they got.
2618,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They solved almost the same amount as the other one did
2619,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The conditions of the task were unfair and did not adjust for X's achievement, which was not that far below Y's."
2620,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was trying to be fair to participant X
2621,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it fair to split the earnings.
2622,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X got 13 problems right.  Should be compensated for something
2623,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He had 1/3 of the correct answers so should get 1/3 of the money.
2624,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   where clear to both participants at the outset. Both presumably agreed to participant according to the shared rules. Thus, BOTH participants should be prepared to live with the final outcome (as determined by the game rules)."
2625,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did work, but it wasn't nearly as good as the other player"
2626,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because if each answered 16 questions, it wouldve been an even split, but one answered double the questions, so they deserve more compensation"
2627,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  although one participant definitely completed more problems, the other still got nine done and should be compensated for the effort"
2628,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose this so that the amounts would be equally divided between the two people,"
2629,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I made this decision due to participant x having no earnings, so I gave him a dollar"
2630,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that both did well and should recieve an amount that was a reflection of how they performed.
2631,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y deserves all the money earned for solving more problems
2632,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one who solved more deserves a bigger portion of the money they earned.
2633,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though X was not able to solve he should be compensated for at least attempting it.
2634,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  person Y submitted more tasks and was paid according to the rules they agreed to
2635,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  felt it was fair
2636,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe in sharing the wealth
2637,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were explained ahead of time. If someone didn't think they'd be strong, they shouldn't invest the time. (But politically, I want some redistribution from high earners! This case was low stakes, so I figured my morals were still ok.)"
2638,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X and person Y knew the situation going in and that if they did less, they would not receive anything. I do not think that taking away from the person who completed more would be fair given the instructions. Although it would be nice, it is a bonus that they did not earn and it is taking from one the one who did. I think only Y should be able to make that decision, not it be made for them."
2639,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt empathy for the participant likely doing their best to try to answer all the questions as fast as possible and ending up with nothing. Judging by the fact that these are real people's lives and that either could be struggling financially, I think a roughly equal split is always most fair in this scenario if possible, and since I was able to make that possible I did."
2641,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  No pay for the median-level performance felt disproportionate. I didn't want to punish good effort, and wanted to reward the excellence, so redistributing too much would feel punitive in the opposite direction."
2642,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided based on how many problems person x solved correctly. Since they only had 3 less right than person Y I thought they deserved at least seventy cents
2643,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X was not too far from receiving a distribution. Therefore, a small distribution is similar to a participation trophy. Getting 12 was not a small feat, and I would recognize the effort."
2645,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants provided work and should be paid accordingly.
2646,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more problems than participant X.  The one who solved more problems should receive a better reward.  We can't all be winners.
2647,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This seemed fair based on the rules
2648,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   still got more pay.
2649,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it was unfair to give them unearned money
2650,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  You explained the rules as being if Participant X solved fewer problems than Y, they would get nothing. This is fair according to the rules."
2651,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because I believe if you have the chance to be fair then do it!!
2652,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't think it is fair that participant X did not win anything just because they answered one question less.
2653,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant Y deserves all of their winnings because they beat the other player.
2655,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered one less problem than participant Y. Participant X should get acknowledged for their work as well. It is only right to split the reward but give Y slightly more
2656,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I dont think it is fair to redistribute the amount earned by either participant.
2657,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it was almost the same number of problems solved; therefore I gave the second participant approximately 45% of the total awarded.
2658,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y outperformed X by a good amount y was just better
2659,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned the money , he got more right answers then X. That was the rule."
2660,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just figured that splitting it in half was the right things to do
2661,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The chips fell where they were supposed to
2662,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered some problems so should be compensated.  However, they did not answer as many problems so should not get as much."
2663,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participants did equal work. I distributed almost even, with .05 more for the participant that solved more."
2664,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x was only 1 question behind participant y
2665,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that Participant X deserves a small stipend for trying. Also, it seems fairer to award Participant X something, and this still leaves Participant Y with 2.00 which is a pretty good payment."
2667,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tried to make it as equal as possible, so the other participant at least makes some earnings."
2668,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to be fair
2669,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  should get something for just showing up
2670,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Fairness  factor
2671,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give y a bit of money.
2673,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the both knew the rules and the winner shouldn't HAVE to give money unless he/she chose to do so.
2674,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Atleast the person who got the least right can get some reward.
2675,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered some correct and therefore should receive something.
2676,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think X should get something because they still solved a great deal of problems
2677,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that they both did their best but that Y deserved a little bonus.
2678,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X must earn a part of the money for the work they have put in.
2679,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the participant who got nothing should at least get a little bonus for solving some of the problems.
2680,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Give them compensation for at least trying
2681,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant made 0, so I felt bad for them and gave them $1.00."
2683,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they got quite a few correct. they should get part of the payout
2684,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave him a fraction of the other participants because it seems a bit unfair that one participant gets everything and the other participant gets none, but I still let the winning participant get most of the earnings because that seems the most fair."
2685,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should have gotten more correct if they wanted winnings
2686,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't think it was fair that X earned nothing when they only solved one problem less than Y did.
2687,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe its equal and fair
2688,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based my decision on merit, and the rules of the game."
2689,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one who got more will still get the majority by far, but I wanted to give a little to the other person for still helping out."
2690,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I'd like to give X something but not by making Y get less than Y is expecting and was told Y would get.
2691,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just think its fair for the money to be split between the 2 participants. They solved almost the exact number of problems correctly so I think they should both receive some of the money.
2692,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  All participants should be paid for the work they provide.
2693,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other person still completed some of the task even if they didn't do as much. They should be rewarded for the amount they did.
2694,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because it would not be fair to y
2695,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions at the beginning of their given task were clear. This is a small amount of money, and the participant who solved the most problems should be able to claim the reward that he/she/they were promised."
2697,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clear. If one participant solved fewer pattern matching tasks than the other, they would be paid nothing. Both parties acted and received the fruits of their actions. Who am I to tamper with the end results? Participant Y solved more problems and therefore deserves the full payment, based on merit. If I were to redistribute Y's earnings, this participant, who is meritorious, may decide not to participate in these activities again."
2698,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to make sure both got a bonus, but since Y did better I felt they should be rewarded slightly better."
2699,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  gave them a tiny amount for actually participating.
2701,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the participant solved fewer problems, I did not feel he was entitled to a reward."
2702,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think Participant X deserves some compensation, especially since they were so close to Participant Y, but I don't want to remove too much from Participant Y because they did earn their spot."
2703,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   so per the rules, they earned the entire payout."
2704,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I struggled a bit on whether I should split it based on number of correct answers or not. I decided to go with not splitting at all as I would prefer that if I were the participant.
2705,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were told the rules before hand, and I feel it would be wrong to change the outcome."
2706,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to allocate participant X 0.50 because although participant Y evidently deserved the larger portion of the reward due to his/her much greater performance in a number of areas, I think it would be more reasonable to reward X with a little sum as a symbol of the simplest acknowledgement of his/her work. Even though the rules were obvious, no reward at all may be a de-motivating experience, particularly when it was not done without any effort. By giving X a small portion, I will be able to balance the merit-based fairness with a small amount of compassion without compromising the incentive scheme of the task to a large extent."
2707,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they knew going into it what the rules were.  You can't take away from Y because you want to make it more 'fair'.
2708,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  So that way another participant also has a share and keep interest in participation
2710,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave this decision because I believe that both participants should gain some benefit.
2711,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I divided the 12 problems by the other 19 problems to get ~63%, and then rounded up to 65%. It then became fairly acceptable to just take off $1 for the other person and give $1.85 to the original participant Y."
2712,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since the difference between participant X & Y was so small, I thought a distribution of the funds was more equitable vs winner take all. To arrive at a number, I compared the ratio of correct response of participant Y to the highest correct response on the chart, which was about 55%. Thus I initially thought of splitting the funds between Y & X, 55/45. But then adjusted up to provide an additional incentive to Y for winning."
2713,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even distribution of payments
2714,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Figured I would give money evenly
2715,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  redistribution from someone with to someone without
2716,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though 1 participant did not do well they did do the task.
2717,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it was fair
2718,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was motivated by equally splitting the winnings across the two partipants.
2720,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like they should receive some compensation. Since they provided less correct answers, I didn't split it 50/50."
2721,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the reward. X accepted the risk so no redistribution.
2722,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant spent time and energy by participating hence should earn something
2723,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought they were fairly close and that it was unfair for X to earn nothing.
2724,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It would not be fair to do it by the number of questions seeing that one had more than the other. I arbitrarily picked 20% as a price for the person with 14.
2726,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They got 11 right, which took some effort. If they had 0, then that shows either no effort, no skill, or a misunderstanding of the directions"
2727,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is a fair competition.
2728,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision is based purely on fairness
2729,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They made an effort even though their response time may be slower.
2731,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should be compensated for the effort
2732,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant may be older, slower and not as capable of doing on-line work but they should receive something for their time."
2733,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Based the earnings between the two participants on the rough ratio of the total correct answers each one got out of the total.
2734,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose .25 because the other participant tried and I feel that should count
2735,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Didnt think an even split was ideal based on difference of numbers correct.
2736,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x did the work although not to the number Y did but he or she deserves a compensation
2737,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was going by the rules. The second person got more right
2738,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did not solve as many problems as Participant Y. The other study says that the participant receives nothing if they solve fewer problems than the other (which happened in this case)
2739,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x did not solve any problems
2740,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Sounds like that was the original agreement and should stand
2741,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It does not seem fair for one participant to not get any money, even though they did successfully complete many questions."
2742,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Fair distribution of assets
2743,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned the payment by performing significantly better, according to the clearly stated rules. Redistributing the earnings would undermine the performance-based incentive and fairness of the task."
2744,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured that's how they would answer as well
2745,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they answered some questions I feel they should get something.
2746,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't really have a reason to redistribute the money? The other participant only got 3 questions right so I don't know why I should reward that, I just stuck to the original plan"
2747,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y earned that money, so it would not be fair for me to take money away from them to give to another participant."
2748,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X should get something for getting 12 right. Participant Y still gets 1.55. Losing a dollar is no big deal.
2749,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to be generous and that is why player Y was given the full amount.
2750,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that it should not be 100:0 because both put in effort, but good performance should be rewarded."
2753,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The should both be paid something.
2754,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Guidelines were clearly stated at beginning.
2755,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just a gut feeling, getting second place by 1 problem should come with some reward"
2757,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think participant X should receive something for solving 10 problems.
2758,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it was more fair for Y to receive a proportional reward, even though the instructions would have precluded it."
2759,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x solved one third
2760,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that X almost completed as many correct puzzles as Y.  They were only 3 shy of meeting Y's 18.  I felt right to give them something for their good effort.
2761,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other person did participate so a little compensation would be nice.
2762,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  rules of the game said 0 for less correct answers
2763,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   participant at least some compensation for completing the task.
2764,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it was fair to not distribute part of X's earnings because they worked harder to solve more problems.
2768,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did 1/3rd of the work roughly so about .90 seemed appropriate.
2769,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant 1 tried hard, not as much as their partner. Some small amount should be given for the effort.  A fifth seems about right to me."
2770,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I based it on the fact  that Y got more correct answers so earn a little more than X ... not fair to give X nothing
2771,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seemed like a fair amount to distribute. That is how I came to my final decision.
2772,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the person that earned the money answered the questions correctly and should not be penalized by that and have to give money away to someone who did not. Perhaps this person paid more attention and really tried hard and that is the reason they answered more correctly.  It shouldn't have to be taken away from that person and given to someone who may not have tried as hard or had the skills that person had.
2773,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both made an effort and both took the same amount of time out of their day. A higher score does not contribute anything to society, it's just a score, a game. So both deserve approximately equal amounts."
2774,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tried to divide it by how many correct answers that they got in total.
2775,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant was already told they'd be receiving a certain amount based on if they got more than other people. I feel like it'd be unethical or unfair to change the rules after everything has finished like that, and they should get what they signed up for"
2776,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the earnings are based off answers its not fair to split it when the person who earned more actually deserves it
2778,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  An even split seemed fair enough in my eyes
2779,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It just seemed reasonable.
2780,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is only fair that both participants be equally compensated.
2781,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tried to keep it fair and keep the amounts about the same.
2782,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I tried to transfer $ to the poor performer but entered the incorrect value, twice, and gave up."
2783,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To try to equal out they pay out
2784,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were established in advance and should be followed.
2785,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  that was the agreement made before the exercise, no reason to change it"
2786,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave that score for effort the other party is trying to answer and give time as well as myself
2787,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like Participant X should get something for their effort as they answered some questions correctly. However, Participant Y should get the larger reward since their performance was better."
2788,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did better, so they should be rewarded more. However, I think it unfair that Participant X doesnt get any extra reward for something beyond their control."
2789,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Double the work = about half of the other's earnings
2790,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want to be fair and honor the agreement. That agreement was honoring the terms everyone agreed with
2791,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It didn't seem fair to give anything to the other person money who earned much less
2793,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  18 questions is pretty good, too good to not receive anything, but Y should maintain a majority of the reward, so I believe .50 is a valid compromise somewhat agreeable to both"
2794,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules
2795,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My amount was based on the rules set from the beginning. If you answered the most amount, you received most of the reward."
2796,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I divided the 3.30 by 22 and got each answer was worth .15 so then I multiplied the .15 by 12 and got $1.80.
2797,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X took the time to do the work and scored pretty close to Y so I thought they deserved a little something
2798,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  , and my decision made me uncomfortable.  But, I also felt it shouldn't be up to me to take away money someone else earned."
2799,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Why worked harder than x getting more questions correct. You work harder you get rewards.
2800,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not want to contribute.
2801,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't agree with the distribution rules, and thought paying a lesser earning participants a small share would keep that individual motivated to make money and not become another welfare burden."
2802,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave $1.00 to participant X because I believe that they deserve it for the questions solved. Participant Y still deserves a bigger share because they solved more problems.
2803,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x took the time to take the survey. They should be compensated for their time.
2804,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He still answered a majority of the questions, so, there should be some reward"
2805,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just to share the profits.
2806,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Second participant earned what they got based on the rules.
2807,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is a more equal distribution, based on my distribution"
2808,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did the tasks and should be compensated
2810,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I try to be a fair person so I wanted to split the money between the two
2811,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they probably tried hard, but its not his fault he didnt know the answers."
2812,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were previously explained that they would only be paid if they solved more puzzles than the other participants.
2813,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It just seems more fair to split it evenly.
2816,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that Participant X needed to be paid at least something for working on the task, but that it would be fair to pay them less since they had solved less problems. I settled on the exact sum in a somewhat intuitive manner, making it worthwhile for both to have done the task, and rewarding the best worker with more money."
2817,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that since the participants were told that there may be a second phase to detirmine payment it was fair to redistribute the reward.
2818,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clearly explained to both participants. The bonus was earned by the one who answered more questions correctly. I think it is not necessary to redistribute the bonus.
2819,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y got significantly more questions correct than X. Either X wasn't paying attention or wasn't matched well.
2820,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of participant Ys earnings because the rules were clear from the start: earnings depended on outperforming the paired participant. Y solved more problems and earned the reward fairly. Redistributing would undermine the incentive structure and effort-based merit.
2821,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They knew when they started this that they would only be paid if they answered at least as many as the other person.  Why should the person who did the best have their earnings taken away?  Esp. after it was explained clearly in the first place.
2822,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were clearly written. The participants knew the rules. The rules should be applied as described.

2824,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X answered 13 questions correctly and Y answered 15 questions correctly. The total payout is $2.25. To be more equitable, I decided to share the money between the two, giving more to Y because he answered two more questions correctly than X."
2825,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant X did make an effort and Y still getting double that without needing double the correct answers
2826,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This was competition based, and they both knew the rules."
2827,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like it is a game and the winner should recieve the money
2830,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x performed better than participant y.
2831,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules in the game were that they would receive nothing if they did not meet the parameters. They did not do as many puzzles as the other, so they got zero. I don't think it is fair to punish the person that won!"
2832,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  13 questions were correct
2833,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel as though the amount should be split as evenly as possible between all participants
2834,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  
2835,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not like to not be paid for work that I do, so I decided to re-distribute a small amount.  It is hard to tell how much effort was given by the lower performing participant, but they did solve less than half of the other participant.  That is why it was just a small amount."
2837,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want to let the original decision stand. There was a clear winner so let them win.
2838,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like Y did better and should earn slightly more for that, but X still put in work and did weel generally, and should have some reward for that"
2839,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was trying to split the money evenly so both participants would have something.  I didn't want the one person to get nothing.
2840,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give the participant a fair amount of money for the questions they answered correctly whilst also making sure I didn't take too much away from the other participant.
2841,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The guidelines for compensation were given before the questioning began.
2842,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that both participants made an effort and it was unfair that one participant received nothing.  I allowed an almost equal distribution of the funds which seemed more reasonable and fair.
2844,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved more problems than x so they deserved the biggest part of it however x still deserved some
2845,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Wealth distribution is socialism. I do not adhere to that philosophy.
2846,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were made clear to both participants and they knew the risk of not getting paid.
2847,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since the participant only did 5 out of 24, that tells me that they made very little effort. The other participant did three times as many. Therefore, my decision stands that the participant that only did 5 doesn't deserve any of the money."
2848,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didn't want to be rude to be honest.
2849,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The numbers where so close it isn't fair to that participants time to not get a bonus
2850,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told that there would be a final round that may affect their distributions. I allocated a nominal amount to the losing participant.
2851,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  he didn't do that much different
2852,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to split, $1.27  but I was not able to use the decimal point when answering."
2853,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Its only fair. Im considering fairness so that way everybody will take a little something home rather than one person take something home and the other one not.
2854,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told how their earnings were to be determined before they participated in solving the problems. The participant who completed th most problems correctly would get paid, the other would not. It is basically a competition that you have to win. Winners should receive what they won, or earned by winning. They shouold not have their amount depleted by the person who did not win."
2855,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both took the time to do the study (time=money) that is how the world works.  It is unfair to reward one person 100% of the money.  I split it $1 and $1.87 because to me, if you are giving a bonus for getting more correct then that is fine (that's the .87) but both should have gotten a baseline of 1.00 because that is fair."
2856,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that one shouldnt get everything and the other person getting nothing.
2857,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  CpX should be paid for the work they did.
2858,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured it was the fair decision to make with each participating equally.

2860,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  x tried hard and solved 7 problems so i think it  feels fair to give them something
2861,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought the premise of the exercise was clear and the rules followed.  So I saw no need to intervene.
2862,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to give X something b/c they did a bit better than average. But I wanted to give Y more b/c they performed very well.
2863,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Share
2864,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The correctly solved many more problems.
2865,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that they did more work so they earned it
2866,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Should be a sum for his work
2867,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were set up by the team doing the evaluations so they should remain as set
2868,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant correctly did 7 more puzzles than the other one. But, the one that did 10 also did a good job of getting that many correct. I think they deserve something for their effort."
2870,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  7 is about a third of 20. So, 1/3 of $3.00 is $1.00."
2871,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think they're closer to eachother
2872,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was based on what I think is fair. Each person should receive the bonus as stated in the rules.
2874,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x really put forth an effort and should be awarded something
2875,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because Participant Y did far more.
2876,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered almost as many correct answers so they should receive some compensation
2877,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute any of participant Y's earnings because the rules were clear from the beginning. It wouldn't be fair to give participants' earned money to another participant. It feels fair to keep it that way.
2878,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that each person should receive an equal amount
2879,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did that because both participants knew the rules, and since Y solved more tasks than X, it is right that he gets everything. Rules are rules."
2880,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I paid for what they answered
2881,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x  took time to try and answer the questions to the best of their ability and should be rewarded accordingly
2882,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that even though they only got two answers right they tried their best. They got two right which means they should at least get a little bit.
2883,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 12 problems and should be awarded something for the effort they made. Participant Y solved 6 more problems than participant X hence it is fair to award both.
2884,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participants need to be compensated fairly for their time as well
2885,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told that if they solved fewer problems than their partner they would be paid 0.  Since that expectation was set up front, if they get paid nothing, then they would assume that they solved fewer problems."
2886,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person who earned their reward should not be punished.
2887,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant Y's earnings to participant X, aiming to balance fairness and performance-based outcomes given their relativelyÂ closeÂ scores."
2888,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it seems like a fair split
2889,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Cause the blue has more
2890,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x did answer a few questions correctly so I felt like a small amount was warranted
2891,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figure that they should earn something for participating, even if they didn't get it right. It's similar to if I do one of these surveys and I don't get everything right--I should earn a little just for doing the exercise."
2892,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y has been better and has fairly earned the compensation
2893,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both played the games one equal terms, and player X did not win, so to be treated fairly player Y should get all the winnings they deserve."
2894,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered less questions, but they were near the top of the average distribution of questions answered."
2895,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I calculated approximately what the value of 12 versus 19 would produce out of the total of 2.85 in total earnings. I redistributed one dollar to participant X from this total leaving the remainder for participant Y based on their 19 answers. Y still earned more but in a more fair and just fashion, yes, it was fair in my opinion to give the dollar to X based on the 12 answers achieved."
2896,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Tasks needed to be completed for earnings
2897,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that x should get half
2898,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I didn't want to give 0 to anyone. I think for the 9 correct answers .25 is fair.
2899,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person x should also be given a certain share of the amount. The amount I have choosen is to try and equalise both of them.
2900,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X only  solved two problems less than Participant Y, I thought it fair that they should get a little less than half the reward."
2902,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   It is ambiguous whether we are giving a portion (i.e., fraction) or an amount of USD.  Because both X and Y are in the bottom half of participants, I thought it fair to give X some of Y's reward in spite of the initial statement of 0.15 USD per correct answer. Since Y did better than X, Y should earn more than X. I then made up an adjustment giving 1/3 to X based roughly on their scores relative to the average."
2903,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since they did participate they should get paid something for their effort
2904,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't like taking from one person to give to another.
2905,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Everyone gets paid the same for how many puzzels they solve.
2906,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The performance of the two individuals was extremely close, so it is fair to make the distribution between the two individuals almost equal."
2907,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant that received did around 75% of the same amount of work the other participant did, and 0 for them didn't seem completely ok, so I decided to give them the small amount."
2908,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i wanted to give the other participant something instead of nothing
2909,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did almost as well as Y, and shouldn't be penalized."
2910,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would be for even symbolic grstification. Somethig
2911,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it was left than half and since one had 13 right and the other 9 i thought it was only  fair to share some of it with him
2912,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did participate even if they didn't do well. I am assuming they tried and not everyone does well at everything but at least they participated and provided data for this study. I am actually thinking now that I should have given them more.
2913,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If a person gives it an honest try but just doesn't have the capability to perform well they should still get a small reward.
2914,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seemed that participant X should get something since they solved almost as many as participant Y, but half would be too much, so I decided on one dollar."
2916,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that the system prior to my input was fair and because only ony participant was able to finish in time they deserve the reward that they got.
2917,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because he/she did not get any questions correct.
2918,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt since X had answered 8 questions correctly they should be compensated also.
2919,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The allocation of funds was explained in the beginning so X and Y each agreed to the risk.
2921,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules are the rules.
2922,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I'm competitive. The pay might be an extra incentive to try harder.
2923,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just wanted to give that amount because x didnt answer enough correctly so it wouldnt have been fair to give more
2924,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participants X also solved some challenges. Giving them 0.00 dollars would be very unfair
2925,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant X got some right so they should get something.
2926,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The first participant worked hard and got many of the answers correct and should be compensated for some of their work.
2927,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X performed twice as well as Y so I wanted X to keep 2/3rds of the $.
2928,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because X did have 8 correct answers, I think it is only fair they are compensated a little at least."
2929,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y clearly did better and earned his or her full bonus fairly.
2930,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's good to share
2931,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They still put forth effort, and they got a lot of questions done, so they deserve something, but not a lot since they did not meet the requirements."
2932,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y worked so very much harder, and I did not feel that they should have any funds removed.  Had the payment been larger I may have decided to take a bit for X, but the payment was not large."
2933,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to distribute the money equally because I would want some compensation if I was one of the participants.
2934,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant only missed one question so deserved something.
2935,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To promote equality
2938,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That person did almost as many problems and should be compensated accordingly.
2939,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The original rules that both parties agreed to have not changed.  B should not be penalized because of an arbitrary decisionmaker.
2940,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that they should at least have a small reward.
2941,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To me, it just seemed like Y did the work that led to their earnings, so I shouldn't take those."
2942,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It just seems fair since they both answered something
2944,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Give x some credit for work done
2945,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules were defined up front. No need to be wishy washy.
2946,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I choose that because that person did more surveys and they earned that money
2947,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That was almost half and wanted the participant to have some
2948,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  So the participant that didnt receive anything received a little
2949,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  if they both participated in the task, they should both be paid."
2950,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The risk was described in the beginning of the original study.
2952,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to give participant X $0 and let participant Y keep their full $1.65 because the rules of the task were clear, the more problems you solved, the more money you got. Y did much better than X and I think it's fair that rewards are based on effort and performance in this case."
2953,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems only fair. Both people played the game and gave it time and effort. Both should receive something.
2954,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did work on the task but did not make that much as Participant Y did. Participant X should be given 1 USD for the work done.
2955,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants knew the rules before they started the exercise and both were willing to take the same risk.  One of the participants won the exercise.
2956,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate X has completed way more questions than Participate Y and it seems like they didnt try to compete for the earnings
2957,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X deserves some for their effort.
2958,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Hey, that person who only got half the number right is probably like me. They tried really hard but pattern recognition is difficult for them. You are basically telling them they are worthless because they didn't solve as many problems, but they tried! People should be rewarded for their work in proportion to how much they accomplished."
2959,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that the other participant earning zero for answering just a couple less questions is wrong.
2960,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it was fair to split the reward in half for both participants.
2961,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told in advance what the payout criteria would be. I see no need to reward substandard performance.
2962,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did so much better that i feel like they earned the right to keep their money
2963,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't like the terminal redistribution what I like is that they got $.15 for each puzzle they completed.
2964,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The inequality is too high
2966,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want the most money
2967,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  sounded fair for both doing the survey
2968,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave an amount roughly based on the ration of X and Ys correct answers.
2969,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  1 seems fair to me
2970,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's a study and work was done. Participation awards should be about the same for everyone who puts in the time and effort. It's not real work.
2971,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I dont see how this could ever be equal as one participant will always solve fewer problems so I thought they should both rewarded simply for participating.
2972,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It will make things more even for both workers.
2973,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y managed to solve more problems correctly,therefore, redistributing their earnings would not be aligned with my values:those that earn,are those that decide where their earnings go."
2974,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the original offere was fair and participant x didn't complete enought questions
2975,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It should be fair they did answer a few question do they should get paid also.
2976,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that given that both did the same thing in that they took the time to do the problems even if it was only a few of them. In my mind X deserved some sort of reward
2977,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both answered some questions
2978,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They both entered the study in good faith, we must assume. They did the same study, they put forth the same effort. They should receive the same compensation."
2979,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were informed about the rules before they solved the problems. The money the winning participant earned is rightfully his or hers. Actually, if I could go back a page, I would have taken nothing."
2980,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They agreed to the terms before participating in the event.
2981,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to split it somewhat evenly
2982,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Due to the fact that person Y solved almost twice as many problems correctly I didnt think it would be fair to give many of their earnings to person X so I just chose to give 50 cents.
2983,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X only earned 3 less than participant y
2984,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The task for the participants required each of them to be within the same amount of correct questions of each other for a 15 cent payout. The participants in this task had one with a massive lead over the other, so the other did not get a payout."
2985,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The all-or-nothing reward system seemed excessive, but the better performer should receive a bonus for their performance."
2986,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did some of the problems and should be rewarded for that time spent.
2987,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The outline of participation and payout was predetermined before the event took place, it would be unethical to change the rules after the fact."
2988,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told there could be a change in the final distribution. They both answered questions correctly and were very close in terms of correct answers. While the first-place person should get the most due to the conditions of the test, the other one should not be penalized completely for their own success and arbitrary pairing with another person."
2989,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Following the prescribles rules Y gets the money and X gets nothing.
2990,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If participant Y gets $0.15/per each problem correctly solved, and participant X solved 3, participant X should get paid for the amount of problems solved."
2991,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since participant x had about half of the questions right compared to participant y, I figured that 1/4 of y's earnings could go to them."
2993,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the other participant should at least get some compensation for their efforts and for participating.
2994,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were outlined at the beginning. I have no reason to countermand them.
2995,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate x did solve 11 problems and deserves some sort of compensation
2996,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because X and Y entered in to this study knowing the consequences. I wasnt going to give X any thing, but changed my mind at the last minute, but now I do believe that indeed X shouldnt have gotten anything, even though I answered otherwise. It isnt fair for X and Y to get the same amount or any amount, as the case is, for not knowing the answers. It reminds me of the same participation trophys that have been given to all kids on both baseball teams, even though there was a winner and a loser."
2997,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt like X should get something. But didn't solve as many problems as Y, so it seemed like it should be a small amount."
2998,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They each solved about the same amount of problems but only one was rewarded so I decided to do an even split
2999,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to be a good person and share
3000,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   from the basic calculation over to the other participant, despite there being fractional cents."
3001,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He had less to begin with. Why would I want to give the other participant any when he had more?
3002,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were almost equal in the number of problems solved and they both still took the time to participate in the study and clearly tried hard, so I feel that participant x should still get something, just less than participant y"
3004,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  So participant Y only solved around 13 problems, and participant X only solved 24. Given that they have to solve as many as the other participant AND get them correct to get a reward amount, then if we assume that participant X got about half right on average that would be .15 per correct answer times 12 answers equals 1.8. I added a bit more since I'm assuming that participant X got more than have right, which would be 18 questions answer correctly times .15 per accurate answer to get 2.7."
3005,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i consider the final payout
3006,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I dont think in this example one person should get everything. When playing sports or a competition there is only one winner. So for this the person solving 8 solved 40% of the total so out of the 1.79 from other person I took 40% which came out to .425 and rounded down.
3007,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  roughly the same pay per correct answer
3008,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The main reason why I chose that decision was the other option was nothing compared to the 2.55
3010,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X put forth a reasonable amount of effort and solved only 6 fewer questions than participant Y.
3011,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They solved half of the solved problems, so I think half of the provided compensation is fair."
3012,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that even though participant X did not solve as many problems as participant why, they still deserve some earnings but definitely not half. I felt that the best way to redistribute the money would be to give them the .6999999999999997."
3013,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was a semi even distribution between the two people
3014,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel as though the person with the highest correct answers should still receive a good amount more to matter, hence I feel as though 0.85 cents was great for the person who didn't get the most correct answers (with how close they were.)"
3018,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted the participants to get paid according to how well they did in relation to eachother, not just if one got more answers that the other"
3019,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The way the money was distributed before seemed arbitrary.
3020,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the bonus by getting the most correct answers therefore deserves all of the money.
3021,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X appeared to have been a great participant and will be encouraged next time to participate in your studies.  Y and X could have been the top 2 and all the others with 12 and below.  X needs to be compensated something for being in the top percentage.
3022,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that participant X should still be rewarded for their effort. Therefore, I divided the total reward of $1.2 by the total answered questions, 13, to get about 0.09 per question. And then awarded $0.4 to participant X."
3023,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y must have done a better job with the decisions.
3024,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  to ensure fairness and equality
3025,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That felt like a good number
3026,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  its only fair
3028,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even thought Participant Y correctly solved more problems than Participant, X, Participant X still contributed value to the task. An all-or-nothing allotment of reward is not fair."
3029,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did half the work of Y, so X should get half of what Y is getting. However, X was in the lower percentiles so some deductions were made."
3030,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  As close to 50% should be fair.
3031,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X participated and did (presumably) make an effort to complete the assignment. I believe some compensation is fair.
3032,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Rules are rules
3033,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants got what they earned
3034,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because of the semi-equal balance between the questions answered by both person X and person Y.
3035,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Taking this much will make both even to each other
3036,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant who did better should get most of the reward but the other person should still be rewarded for their time
3037,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My suggested decision: Transfer $0.50 (about 16% of Y's earnings) to X which would result in participant X receiving $0.50.  Participant Y receives $2.65. This acknowledges X's effort while still preserving most of Y's reward for their significantly better performance. The exact amount is subjective, but this strikes a balance between fairness and merit."
3038,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think its fair that everyone get something instead of zero
3039,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did a much larger number of tasks.
3040,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it would even things out more but still reward the winner.
3041,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y completed the most questions so they deserve most of the reward but Participant X completed almost as many questions as Participant Y
3042,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose to give $0.85 to participant X to recognize their effort in solving 9 problems, even though they didnt outperform participant Y. While participant Y deserved to earn more for solving significantly more problems, I felt it was fair to give X a small share to avoid a complete loss and acknowledge their contribution. This balances performance-based rewards with some compassion."
3043,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't feel any obligation to share.
3044,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both Participant X and Y achieved results that are well above the average/mean results according to the bell curve. So, they both deserve to be compensated.  Their results were actually fairly even between the two.  I give P. Y more because that was the rule set forth initially."
3045,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rule giving no earning to person who got fewer right answers seemed unfair. I tried to give person X a smaller share of earning than Y because X did not do as well so did not merit as large an earning. I initially thought I would award X 1 but thought that about 1/3 of total was more justifiable given their relative performance.
3047,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant deserves to earn some money for answering correct answers.
3048,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just followed the rules as they were explained to the participants.  Presumably they agreed to that.
3049,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted them to share the money.
3050,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They competed, Y won the competition. X should receive something for taking part in the competition"
3051,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participants X and Y both solved a significant amount of problems, and both deserve some kind of recognition/compensation."
3052,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both knew the rules from the start and agreed to them.  The one who solved the most would get the money.  Easy call
3053,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participate Y worked for their earnings
3054,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would like the other option to keep what they have
3055,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules for monetary awards were clearly defined and explained. Participant X scored much lower than Participant Y and therefore did not earn any money. There is no need to make any award changes according to the rules that both participants accepted.
3057,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just thought that it wasn't fair to take from 1 to give to the other
3059,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  i want it all
3060,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though the participant with the lower Number of 11 participated, I think they should be given something for their work"
3061,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The other participant added value to the process. I feel it is unfair to not pay them anything. I treated the 2.10 as a buckt to be divided.
3062,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Id like to maintain the originals terms of the task, I feel redistributing money from participant Y to X would be a handout to X for not performing better than Y."
3063,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Those were the rules
3064,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He made the choice and took the risk of earning $0.
3065,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is only fair that X receive the same amount as Y...to do anything other would be unethical.
3066,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  uncertain
3067,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  if they was paired as a team it shouldnt matter how many correct answered then the other, if they was a team it should   be split basically evenly"
3068,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  they didnt complete the full task
3069,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since Participant Y solved more problems, they should get the full amount. It wouldn't be fair to give any of their rewards to Participant X, especially considering they knew they wouldn't get any if they answered less problems than Y."
3070,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they answered almost as much as the other person
3071,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It will only be fair if participant X also earn a little from the reward for his or her efforts.
3072,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like the participants both deserved something for it.
3073,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved some of the questions correctly; and should be given credit for that at least.
3074,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that its only fair to give the other participant something because they did solve some of the problems.
3076,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The winner is the winner, stop rewarding the losers."
3077,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved problems and deserved to be paid as Y was
3078,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should be paid for their time regardless of outcome
3079,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Each person earned their reward
3080,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x did have correct answers
3081,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one person did much more work than the other person so they should get some more.
3082,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant got 10 questions correct while the other got 13. I thought it would be more fair if they got rewarded even though they got less correct because of how close 10 and 13 are.
3083,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the fact that one answered more than the other should be considered a game.  We can all profit if we redistribute.
3084,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel as if compensation is always necessary for labor such as this -- 0.6 USD is around 1/3 of 1.79 USD, corresponding with how 4 questions answered is equivalent to 1/3 of 12 questions answered."
3085,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Less than half, token of appreciation for completing 90%"
3086,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I based off of the amount of questions X done compared to Y and assuming I'm splitting between both, I'd sort of give the earnings by a 40/60 ratio"
3087,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that both people should be paid for their time, but participant Y did solve more, so they should get paid more as they were told."
3088,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X failed to answer as many as participant Y but they did manage to solve five problems so I did not award them 15 cents for each correct answer but I did award them a third of that five cents as a consolation for their efforts  I thought that was fair
3089,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because while I was reading the task, it said that if it doesnt get the same amount then one does not get anything"
3090,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant x solved fewer problems and earned nothing
3091,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that both participants too k their time to do the work, so each should get compensated."
3092,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel like Participant X still deserves a bonus for solving some problems, and they only solved 3 less than Participant Y. In my opinion, it would be unfair to distribute the earnings evenly since participant Y still solved more problems, but some distribution to Participant X is still fair and I gave them even less than half so as to not be too unfair to Participant Y."
3093,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person y did more work
3095,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of the survey were explained. Both participants knew that the may not get awarded any additional funds. I don't see how the chart changes that.
3096,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I don't believe that every person is owed compensation, but should be paid based on merit. However, Participant X did in fact put in both time and effort, so I felt an obligatory, small donation should be awarded to them."
3097,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think since they were so close that it was only fair that Participant X got a decent amount of the cut.
3098,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I followed your established rules.
3100,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Honestly a lack of decimal points offered on the keyboard led to me only being able to give approximately half and I wasnt going to give up that much. Its very unfortunate.
3101,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel bad for the other participant for not receiving anything
3102,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe in equity, specially when the other person has put in reasonable effort."
3103,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  everyone to earn what they worked for.
3105,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  From what I saw, it did not appear that participant A put the effort into the project that participant B did so I did not see any reason to redistribute earnings."
3106,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To be able to prioritize how things are distributed
3108,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I divided the earnings by roughly half
3109,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants have pretty close results. It would be better to share the bonus proportionally.
3110,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  At first I was going to give just a percentage of 35% of the payment. When I couldnt do that I gave them .01.  I wasn't positive from the instructions of that payment was in addition to what they earned or there only payment.
3111,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X solved 8 problems so 80 cents seems fair then Partipant Y will receive 1.60 for the 16 tests solved giving them both the same rate per solve.
3112,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X got only 9 correct. If he wants to make more money he should have stayed in school.
3113,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both people worked to get the right answers. giving the one who got a few less right something rather than nothing seems fair to me
3114,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X solved 11 problems matching participant Y's 11 problems.  Y got 4 more than X.  So X deserves payment for the number he matched  with Y.
3115,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is a totally non-sensical and unfair competition, so I would ignore the award schedule and split the earnings 50-50."
3116,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I split the total amount given in half.
3117,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the participant who received .00 should receive something for the time they spent on the project.
3118,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Sometimes people just need a little boost.
3119,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though Y did more X should still be paid for their effort and time
3121,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe they should receive something for participating.
3122,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I found the closest I could to half the person Ys earnings.
3123,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  for equal benefits
3124,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that X had 15 and was very close to Y so X deserved something.
3125,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He solved 13 problems. It costs 1 usd
3126,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Sharing is good
3127,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well, it may be that participant Y worked feverishly to get more answers, while X was lackadaisacal.  The important point is that the participants were briefed ahead of time that only the one with the most answers would be rewarded at all.  Still, I think that anyone who put in that much effort to get 15 answers in (pattern recognition can be hard!)  deserves some recompense, and this is still only half of what Y will get."
3128,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y went to more effort.
3129,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This is what they were told they would be paid if they answered less and they answered less. Significantly less.
3130,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to try to split the money somewhat equally among both participants because it would be the most fair and equal.
3131,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y should get a little more due to performing better, but X should not get anything. I picked an amount that I though was fair."
3132,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It gives them each approximately the same earnings per answer, with a slight edge going to the one who answered most."
3133,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X answered 17 questions, whereas Y answered 19. I assumed that the total questions answered correctly were 36. Therefore I divided X correct answers with the total correct questions from the two participants and got 42% (17/36=42%) then I went ahead and shared the reward of 2.85 as per the percentage of 42% and I got 1.2."
3134,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should get .15 per problem. Approximately
3135,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The payment system was described prior to the participants doing the activity.
3137,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   was aware of that before completing the survey. You always have the option of getting out of the survey before it is completed if you don't want to finish it. The participant could've left the survey at any time. Also, the participant who did get the bonus, was told that he would get $.15 for each answer and to change that would not be fair or ethical."
3138,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  nothing has changed re: how much each participant actually earned.
3139,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe both players should receive 50% each of the total for being partners.
3140,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were due 1/3 of the total winnings due to their response rate, nothing else."
3141,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the rules were known. one won straight & fair. just going to give the other one a little something.
3143,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They did not earn the money, but the participant who solved the most did."
3145,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The original format stipulated that if they solved fewer problems then they're matched partner they would not receive anything.
3146,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I like both participants to have something
3147,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Should be payed for time spent.
3148,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is fair to stick to the original rules of earnings distribution, even if the losing participant was only two points shorter than the winner."
3149,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y's distrubtion was independent from X's
3151,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should share some of the money.
3152,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Best of best takes all.
3153,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well for me, while participant Y clearly earned more through significantly better performance, I believe a small redistribution like $0.10 is a symbolic gesture that acknowledges participant Xs effort without undermining the incentive structure of the task."
3154,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The fact that person x solved 14 problems would indicate that they were trying and not just skipping problems, I think its fair and proportional that they receive some compensation"
3155,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Each earned their pay base on the terms and conditions.
3156,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should still get paid for participating
3157,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  We were kind of a team put together to perform a task, and since participant x answered only half off the questions correctly x should only receive half of their part of the pot."
3158,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because it was stated up front before the participants started the task.
3159,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To make it fair since X was close in solving.
3160,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y solved more, therefore it should be reflected in the distribution of pay.  Also, it is unfair for X to receive 0"
3161,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Fair to both
3162,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured participate X deserved 25% for participating
3164,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that they both were pretty equal in correct answers, with such a small difference of only 2, therefore my decision is that Y gets 1.25 and X gets 1.00. I feel like this is a fair amount for each."
3165,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were told ahead of time about the rules of the contest - winner take all. No need to change that.
3166,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X solved 11 problems, which required a fair effort. Y, however, solved 18 problems and therefore should reap higher accolades."
3167,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the payout should stick with the agreed upon terms
3168,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If X got more correct than Y, then he won the challenge. Not everyone gets to win."
3169,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were 3 questions apart and .15 per question.
3171,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The two participants finished nearly the same amount of problems, but participant Y did have a slight lead. It seems unfair to leave participant X with nothing due to one problem. Participant Y still deserves a bit more than X due to the nature of the reward system."
3172,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  One completed 3 more tasks
3173,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seemed that they were just one correct answer away from each and it didnt feel fair thats should get nothing.
3174,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought it would be fair to give X at least some contributions for the problems they solved, but I still let Y keep most of the earnings since they solved more problems than X did."
3175,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was not clear why nothing was given despite answering 12 right.  The other was paid for their correct answers.  I did not see a reason to take from the $3.
3176,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that even though Y solved more, that X should receive something. I felt $2 was enough compensation for Y and X should get the .55 cents."
3177,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  he/she didn't resolve all the problem but he/she did a few. In my opinion it's not fair to get 0
3178,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X answered 4 questions and should be compensated accordingly regardless of the disparity between X & Y
3179,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X was not very careful or knowledgeable about the question so they deserve all the compensation
3180,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The first person did almost half as the first person, so I thought giving them 1.00 would be fair."
3181,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X completed more than 50% of the questions correctly in comparison to participant Y. Therefore, I believe that a portion close to 50% should be provided to participant X"
3182,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though the one participant only answered 4 questions, I believe they deserve something for their efforts."
3183,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Not being compensated for solving some at least shuts down participant x effort so I feel he should still get something for effort.
3184,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I don't think it's reasonable for one person to get all the money, and the other person to get none -- even if Participant X didn't solve any problems, they still put in a certain amount of time and effort that deserves to be rewarded."
3185,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  After the effort of registering to be aware of this study, I expect that both participants put forth a reasonable effort in trying to solve the problems.  My distribution of $1.25 vs $2.20 is sort of a guestimate of the ratio of 14/23 problems solved. I'd like to reward both for their time."
3186,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X answered 12 correct so I thought they should get at least .05 for each correct answer
3187,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They knew the rules before starting.
3188,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Share the earnings as equal as pissible
3189,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person Y scored more questions right, and receives 15 cents for each of the 14 questions that they answered correctly."
3190,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They understood that they would receive nothing if they solved less than the others and the Y participant deserved the bonus for correctly answering more questions.
3191,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules are the rules. They agreed before participating.
3192,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  . It seemed too arbitrary. Moreover they each knew that $0 was a possibility.
3193,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There is no comp for coming in second
3194,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did complete quite a bit
3195,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I dont think this person deserves it.
3196,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave player X a little less than half the amount player Y recieved.
3197,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Per the initial instructions X should not expect to earn anything; however I felt they should receive some compensation for their time.
3198,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participated, the number of responses of each person were very close."
3199,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Just that dividing it equally is good sportsmanship
3200,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just made it even between the 2
3201,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The correct responses were very close, i.e. 1 answer more for the second participant Y. So, in fairness, I gave a lesser portion to the first participant X."
3202,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They deserved something, but not quite an equal amount."
3203,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  People born slow should not starve
3205,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Without knowing the quality of the twos work, It can only be justly assumed that their work is deemed equal"
3206,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X got half of the answers correct that participant Y got correct. Half of Ys earnings would be too much, but X should get something. I felt 1 would be fair."
3207,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y achieved the highest level of correct answers. Participant X did proportionately better than others and obviously took the study seriously. In truth, I think each should receive the maximum amount for fully engaging in the spirit of the study. But my rationale was that participant X was 26.7 percent slower than Y, so that's the percentage of the 2.25 they should receive."
3208,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X did try to perform all tasks successfully, I assume, but for whatever reason (e.g., they may not have good pattern recognition skills or had technical issues), they didn't perform as well as Y.  The ratio X solutions:Y solutions is roughly 1:3.  Also, X did invest their time in the study.  Therefore, it's worth giving them a reward for their time and effort even though, yes, they were told not to expect anything if their score were lower than their partner's."
3209,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  this sounds like a socialist question. If X received nothing , then it should not be based on what Y did. Y answered twice as many as X, but Y earned almost 3 times more than X. Why should I take away from one person and give it to another?"
3210,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I was unable to add a decimal point
3211,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They were only one point apart
3212,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Want to share a small amount
3213,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answers 13 so should be split payment
3215,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems X didn't work as hard as Y so payment is fair enough
3216,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The stipulations and criteria for earning money was clearly laid out at the beginning of the task. There is no need to penalize nor reward individuals for anything beyond what the results produced.
3217,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to so that they could both have a dollar.
3218,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Win or go homeno trophys for 2nd place
3219,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt participant x should at least get something for their time.
3220,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  
3222,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Well I just assumed I would get the 2.40
3223,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both took part, but the amount completed was different since they both put in work they should each get someyjing"
3224,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that Participant X should be paid something for his efforts, though not as much as Y since he did better."
3225,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did answer questions correctly. Y answered about 1 1/2 times more questions correctly. I just estimated a fair amount to give to X.
3226,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  According to the original rules the person who answered less questions correctly would get nothing so therefore it should stand
3227,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The one who earned the money should keep it.
3228,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because participant Y earned all of their bonus, they should not have some taken away to participant X. They both read and agreed to the terms and conditions that they may not get any bonus, depending on their results."
3229,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My generosity.
3230,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It appears that both participants worked hard to solve as many questions as they could and were very close to solving the same amount.  I feel that both participants should receive something for their effort.
3231,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They at least answered more questions
3232,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both participants may have put in equal or nearly equal time and effort for the task and should therefore be compensated.
3233,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules are the rules.
3234,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I'm not sure. I just felt it was the right amount considering what I read and saw
3235,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X, per the rules, should expect nothing. Their performance was good; they obviously put forth effort.  I feel they should receive something while respecting the fact Y did outperform and serves more."
3237,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were made aware of the payout before starting. Then they decided it was worth the risk. All or nothing.
3239,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  You laid out the conditions before the survey started and both parties agreed. Participant Y should be given what was promised, it's just unfortunate for X that they performed worse."
3241,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to split the total earnings (2.25) according to the number of correct answers, awarding 1.25 the the participant who answered 15 right and 1.00 to the participant who answered 12."
3242,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  getting more money
3243,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They should still get compensated for their efforts
3244,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should not be penalized based on someone else's results.
3246,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should be given something for solving 10 problems...this is only fair.
3247,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that there should be an equitable distribution of the earnings. I felt that was the fair thing to do since they both performed almost the same.
3249,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X and Y knew what the payment system was going in, so it is not my place to take away money from one to give to the other."
3250,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that because X did do over half of what Y did they should get something for their work
3251,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it would be fair if both participants earn a similar bonus.
3252,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  one should get paid based on their performance thus receiving accurate feedback

3254,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants knew the rules before the process and should be paid accordingly.
3255,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Half pay for the correct answers
3256,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X should be paid something for their efforts. I think one third of what Y earned, or one USD, should be sufficient."
3257,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The instructions were clear that if they solved less than the other participant, there would no earnings for them."
3258,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered 11 questions correctly and deserves something for taking part in the study
3259,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person was aware of the rules, and I didn't want to change the outcome."
3260,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participants should always receive something for their efforts.
3261,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x answered more than 10 problems correctly and should get some compensation
3262,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participants X and Y were one question away from being tied.  I decided it was not fair to award all of the bonus to one participant and made the split more proportional.
3263,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that it is only fair to provide something to participant X since they participated and solved some problems, although not as many as participant Y."
3264,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think each participant should receive what they actually earned.
3266,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought the payment distribution method wasn't clear to the participants so it only fair to equalize their earnings for the task.
3267,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Not knowing who the other participant is provides no motivation to share any distribution.
3268,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I had compassion without being strict.
3269,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  He answered more so he will get the full amount
3270,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Neither of them did very well, so I added their answers together (30) divided that into 2.40, got an average per answer and paid them accordingly."
3271,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not think the money should be redistributed.   One player clearly won the money and the other did not.
3272,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It sucks when you don't get part of the bonus. It did say there may be a redistribution. So I  decided to redistribute half of the .15 per the 7 completed. Person X will get .52 for effort and participation
3273,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules stated how each would be paid and the rules matter.
3275,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did way more work than X. However X's worked should not go unnoticed. I understand the rules, but i would feel bad not giving them anything."
3276,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because x didn't receive anything
3277,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I choose to give person X  $1.00 because they solved 10 solutions.
3278,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  This was the original amount that they earned under the terms of the survey. I don't see any reason that it should be changed.
3279,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They answered some of the problems correctly so they should be paid for their contribution.
3280,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y has to earn more because he deserves it but it would be so unfair for X so go home empty handed
3281,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved more problems and earned the payment fairly under the stated rules. I chose not to redistribute because the outcome reflects their performance.
3282,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I just feel things should be split evenly.
3283,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X did a lot of work and should get compensated something percentage wise.  My math maybe a bit off for it.
3284,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They need to be paid for their time
3285,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is the most fair amount for participant X to receive. It makes sense participant Y gets the most of his earnings.
3286,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I do not think that the participant deserves any of the other one's reward, because they did not earn it."
3287,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Share equally in the outcome
3288,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose not to redistribute because participant Y earned the money fairly by solving more problems.
3289,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X deserves to be paid at least a minimal amount for taking the time to participate, and for having a reasonable number of correct responses.  Meanwhile, participant Y still retains the lion's share of the reward, so their motivation would still be high."
3290,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I want both participants to earn a bonus of some amount, but the participant who answered more questions deserves a slightly higher amount."
3291,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel as if both tried. The higher performer deserves more but the other individual should be compensated also.
3293,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y eared the full amount for answering the most questions.  Participant X should have been better prepared.  There are no participation trophies in life.
3294,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They still got some questions right and the first person wont miss the 59 cents
3295,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I added participant X and Ys total scores together, divided Ys pay by the total score, then times the divisiob by 6 to get Xs rightful share"
3296,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the money and it is only fair Y gets to decide wht to do with the money
3297,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The winning margin was not huge. Winner should not get it all
3298,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Share
3299,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to redistribute less than half of the total for participant Y, so that in the end, participant Y will still earn more and participant X will not end up with nothing."
3300,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted to compensate them for their effort.
3301,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the payment and X did not. Why should it be shared?
3302,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it is only fair that they both should share in the pay.  X  put forth the effort and should also be paid.
3303,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Pay for time exerted
3304,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both participants completed their assigned tasks fully, even though one was given twice the amount of equations to solve, the participants did not have a choice in how many equations they were given, so the one who solved more should get more, but I think the one that only received 7 equations to solve should still get a little something"
3305,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt they did a pretty good job of the task and deserve at least something, but not as much as 50%."
3306,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X answered 4 questions correctly. As such, I feel that Participant X should be entitled to 15 cents per correct answer. 4 correct answers X .15 per correct answer equals 60 cents.  In reality, Participant X should probably only get 1/2 of that amount, as they should split the proceeds equally on the answers they both answered correctly, but since there was such a massive variance (20 correct answers between them), in this case I think it is OK to just let Participant X have the whole 60 cents."
3307,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Gave them half.
3308,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that X did the same amount of work, but did not quite score as highly as Y.  There should be a more equitable distribution."
3309,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I suppose I don't think Y is obligated to give x anything from their winnings.
3310,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think X did some work even if it wasn't as much as Y. X did about 13% of the work Y did.  So I gave 25 cents to X because that is close to 13%. I assumed that the skill set of both participants was the same, and I assumed that the puzzles given to solve were of the same difficulty."
3311,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  A fairer distribution of assets
3312,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Base on the information provided
3314,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even things out for everyone
3315,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did very well and should be rewarded the most. Participant  x should get something for the effort.
3316,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think each participant should receive what they earned, rather than the earnings being redistributed between the two. This is the most merit-based way to compensate the participants."
3317,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I give $1 out of $2.1 from Y because I want to share a part of what Y gives me nearly half  with X
3318,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the amounts were not distributed then the other person would have got nothing for his time and effort
3319,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because i believe in giving a person something just for trying
3320,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules stated if one participant solved less than the other, they would not receive anything."
3321,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  person y solved more problems, so they should get the earnings"
3322,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Person X scored less than Person Y.  As per the stated rules, Person Y would receive $2.85 and Person X would receive 0.00.  This seems fair to me."
3323,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Guesswork
3324,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to redistribute earnings is motivated by a balance between fairness and recognition of effort. While participant Y solved more problems and earned a higher reward based on performance, Participant X also put in significant effort by solving 21 problems. Sharing some of the earnings acknowledge Participant X'S hard work without completely disregarding the merit-based outcome, promoting a sense of fairness and encouragement for both participants."
3325,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules for earnings were provided to participants that the outset so maintain them is only fair.
3326,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My own experience with money motivated my decision.
3327,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Seemed like a fair distribution for correct answers
3328,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I didnt see any reason to change the rules of the game. I would have split the winnings if they were tied.
3329,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It's a game with little renumeration.  Pay the participants roughly an equal amount for their trouble.
3330,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that despite the abilities of either participant that they should be compensated equally
3331,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  all or nothing feels too harsh. I think that 1/3 and 2/3 is more fair
3334,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I pro-rated the work. In all, 23 problems were solved, and person X solved about 15% of them, so should get 15% of the earnings. Well, maybe not quite that - 15% is almost $.50, and it is hard to justify giving person X that much. So $.30 is what I decided."
3335,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems they might have had nearly as many answers correct, so why not share?"
3336,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  all or nothing is harsh
3337,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think that the winner should take all and that answering more problems should be rewarded.
3338,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I gave the participant one forth of the total amount. Since they only answered half as many questions right. If they both answered same amount right would go fifty-fifty.
3339,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  he did two questions.
3340,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  approximately 5/18ths.
3341,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participants were explained the rules of the study before and that if they had less answers then they would be payed less. Participant X had less and therefore according to the rules shouldn't receive anything.
3343,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think it is fair to go 50/50 in cases like this so that everyone is happy.
3344,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe it is fair given the current circumstances. If I could give more at a reasonable amount, I would."
3345,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that participant x should should receive some income even though he or she was the looser, they did their best and should at least have a small reward"
3346,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The reward should be more or less proportional to the number of questions answered correctly.
3347,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It seems like the right thing to do.
3348,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X's participation was a factor for the survey/study and while they did not answer the most, they did participate, I think a 75/25 split is fair as their time is important too"
3349,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the $; X did not
3350,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I believe that the participant's efforts should be rewarded but not as much as the other participant who answered more questions
3351,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision follows the rules set forth for the study and based on the results.
3353,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The guidelines were clearly stated, so I was just abiding by them."
3354,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They didnt put in the work like the other participant
3355,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant earned the money; therefore should get all the money.
3356,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X answered five questions  and y answered 7 so y deserves more money than x.
3357,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Seems fair, as long as the effort was put in."
3358,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both parties contributed effort to the project, both should be rewarded."
3359,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that the rules were the rules and there should be no second-place winner.
3360,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did better and deserves the reward.
3361,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  About one third. I believe top performers should earn the bulk of the reward, however, it isn't right to make it all-or-nothing, It would discourage others from even trying"
3362,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Even though Y had more correct answers, X did contribute and should receive some compensation."
3363,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I figured to divide the earnings, while giving the participant to completed the most questions the bigger share of the portion. I figured it would be fair if they both at least got something since even if one person did a bit less work, they still did work regardless."
3364,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  both worked on it and while one may have had slightly more success, its luck of the draw on something like this"
3365,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I picked 3. Your instructions are vague and don't make much sense to me.
3366,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant who answered more questions correctly deserves the money because according to the rules, the participant who answered less questions right does not get any."
3367,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  participant y worked a lot harder
3368,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It was close enough that X should get some compensation but not equal.
3369,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The amount of answers that were done correctly is what should matter.  Rushing through this is not conforming with the reason for the study.
3370,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X put in effort with 16 correct answers, but didn't receive any payment, and I believe a partial redistribution is appropriate to recognize X's efforts."
3372,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Awarded for getting even 6 correct.
3374,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It appears to me that X did better in their grouping than Y did in their's. Thus, a sharing of the wealth is appropriate."
3375,"Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought that since Participant Y did more work, they should get some more credit. Also, participant X was being too cautious with a low guess of 5, so for their added caution, they should receive less since they risked less."
3376,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  cause i think it's only fair to get that amount
3377,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I decided to move a modest $0.15 from participant Y to participant X because that strikes a reasonable balance between rewarding superior performance and avoiding an outcome that feels unduly punitive to the lower scorer. Y unquestionably earned most of the money by solving six puzzles, three times Xs total, so Y should keep the lions share. At the same time, X did invest effort and produced two correct answers; awarding absolutely nothing would signal that any contribution short of first place is worthless. By shifting a small fractionone-sixthof Ys payoff, X receives a token acknowledgment while Y still walks away with the majority of the earnings, meaning the incentive for excelling is largely preserved."
3378,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel that Participant X deserves some reward for their effort in the study.  However, since Participant Y solved more problems they should be rewarded with the majority of the payment."
3379,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Why not be fair
3380,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  it seems fair for the time taken but insufficient number of answers
3381,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The participant was told the rules prior to the pairing.  The rules should stand.
3382,"Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  According to the rules, X would not get anything if Y solved more so I stuck with the rules."
3383,"Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that 16 is the winner but 15 is awfully close I thought like horseracing win, place, show"
3384,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is a more fair distribution.
3385,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Individual doesn't deserve it
3386,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought each player should received the same amount of compensation each task that was completed.
3387,"Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:   Also, receiving no reward may inspire the other person to do better next time."
3388,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt X deserved some payment for volunteering to participate
3389,Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  There has to be a redistribution between participant X and Y for fairness to participant X who also solved 11 questions.
3391,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y knew the rules to earn a bonus but did not perform well.
3392,Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because they both did good on answering and they should be paid accordingly
3393,Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  What motivated my decision is Participant X's hard work of solving those questions.
3394,Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y did better but I didn't want X to have nothing.
