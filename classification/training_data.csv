2794,libertarian,the rules
2849,meritocrat - does mention the margin,The numbers where so close it isn't fair to that participants time to not get a bonus
2532,libertarian,The instructions said that the person with fewer correct answers would get nothing and the person with the most correct answers would get .15 per correct answer. Changing the bonus would not be right or moral.
568,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Although Participant Y solved 16 problems and Participant X solved 12 problems, I feel both should be compensated. Participant X should get something for solving the problems although they did not complete as many."
209,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"since they both took their time to solve the tasks they both deserve to receive a bonus, i allocated 2 dollars to participant Y because he solved more and the rest $1.15 goes tp participant X"
3374,misunderstand,"It appears to me that X did better in their grouping than Y did in their's. Thus, a sharing of the wealth is appropriate."
2120,libertarian,I had no reason to take what they earned.
1363,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"I chose to allocate some of the earnings of participant Y to participant X since he solved fewer problems, and it would be fair to redistribute some in this instance."
1481,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Xdid answer 11 questions. Even though Yanswered 4 more wuestions-I feel X should be given something for trying to answer as many as she could.
1497,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"I feel like participant X lost by 6 to participant Y. Because of their results being close, I feel like participant X should b rewarded something for solving some right."
1252,misunderstand,"maybe I failed to understand you fully but if one is getting 15 cents for each questin answered correctly, then participant x deserved to get sth agter answering 20 correct questions. Thats why I sacrificed 1 dollar.,"
731,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"The one participant guessed slightly less correct, so I felt like they deserved some money, but not fully half."
2999,egalitarian,to be a good person and share
1882,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Participan y deserved the full payment
3121,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I believe they should receive something for participating.
1219,meritocrat - does mention the margin,Because he solved 1 less than participant Y hence equal distribution seemed a bit fair
1335,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Y did better and should therefore benefit more than X
1133,fairness,It promotes fairness.
372,libertarian,The rules were to only compensate whoever answered more questions than the other.
1230,meritocrat - does not mention margin,The main motivation is to acknowledge the efforts made by the other participant. It feels like a fair decision.
2321,egalitarian,equality
1631,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Even though it doesn't follow the stated rules, it seemed fair to compensate the person for answering 15 questions."
3287,egalitarian,Share equally in the outcome
2383,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"Participant Y did solve more problems than Participant X, but only a few more.  Participant should receive a reward for their time and effort, and the number of problems they solved."
2927,meritocrat - does mention the margin,X performed twice as well as Y so I wanted X to keep 2/3rds of the $.
1707,incentives,To encourage participant X to solve more problems next time
1946,meritocrat - does not mention margin,They both participated and solved problems.
2076,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I think that participant X should also be recognized for the work they did.
227,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I considered participant X's effort hence giving the 1 dollar
1881,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I think it's only fair to reward the person that got the most correct
3010,meritocrat - does mention the margin,X put forth a reasonable amount of effort and solved only 6 fewer questions than participant Y.
605,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"My decision was based on the fact that both participated and the chances that one would end up with nothing and one would end up with all would not be fair. The amount was able to be split to a more even amount for both participants. Also, I feel according to the rules the winner should still benefit more than the loser and thought that something slightly more/less than half would be sufficient enough. This is all due to the fact that I , being the decision maker, is aware of the rules for the participants of the previous study."
2193,meritocrat - does mention the margin,The fact that Y got almost twice as many right as X was my primary driver. Because Y did better did not mean they should have to redistribute their earnings at all.
401,fairness,fairness over competition
3291,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I feel as if both tried. The higher performer deserves more but the other individual should be compensated also.
1400,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I thought it was fair that the person who did the work should get paid more.
2956,meritocrat - does mention the margin,Participate X has completed way more questions than Participate Y and it seems like they didnt try to compete for the earnings
2895,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"I calculated approximately what the value of 12 versus 19 would produce out of the total of 2.85 in total earnings. I redistributed one dollar to participant X from this total leaving the remainder for participant Y based on their 19 answers. Y still earned more but in a more fair and just fashion, yes, it was fair in my opinion to give the dollar to X based on the 12 answers achieved."
2089,meritocrat - does mention the margin,I chose this amount because person x completed about half as many questions as person y.
1067,meritocrat - does mention the margin,BECAUSE HE PARTICIPATED IN DOING SLIGHTLY LESS QUESTIONS THAN y
2161,meritocrat - does mention the margin,I thought is was a more fair distribution of funds based on the productivity of the participants.
1270,meritocrat - does mention the margin,I would give 1.00 to participant X to recognize their significantly greater effort and performance compared to participant Y.
329,meritocrat - does not mention margin,participant x also participated it is only fair if he is paid something for the time he took to answer the questions
1488,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"If the decision-making task was purely chance, I would say to share the money. But if time and thought went into solving the problems, Participant Y earned the money. That was based on skill and intellect.  I am okay with getting paid for skill and intellect."
177,meritocrat - does mention the margin,I felt it was fair to give the other person at least some bonus because they solved only 1 less problem correctly.
233,libertarian,Participant Y solved double the problems that participant X solved. So I figured it was fair to stick with the way they were told the money would be distributed. I gave it all to the participant who solved the most problems.
1560,logic,because it seem like the most logical answer
2995,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Participate x did solve 11 problems and deserves some sort of compensation
2433,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"Assuming that both participants spent the same amount of total time on the task and put forth the same effort, I'm not sure one should be rewarded more for performing faster. Some people just don't test as quickly as others and I'm generally a fan of quality over quantity. It's hard to determine this without more information, but my inclination given that most participants completed around 14-16 problems is to divide the money equally."
643,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Participant Y should earn more, but participant X should also earn something."
1864,libertarian,"My decision to give $0.00 of participant Ys earnings to participant X was motivated by a commitment to fairness, merit, and respecting agreed-upon rules. Both participants were informed of the conditions before the task began: only the higher performer would be rewarded. Participant Y earned the payout by solving more problems, while participant X did not meet the threshold to earn money. Redistributing the earnings afterward would undermine the integrity of the incentive structure and create uncertainty for participants who relied on the original rules. Upholding the terms that were clearly communicated and agreed upon supports trust and fairness in the study."
151,libertarian,"It is fair not to distribute anything because the rules were clear, and earnings were to be based on relative performance, and you solved for more than 15 times times X 10"
810,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Participant x participated and answered 8 questions, as a little reward for taking part in the participation."
3307,no reason,Gave them half.
164,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Both exhibited good effort
314,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"Assuming Player X tried their best, they deserve something for their time."
296,meritocrat - does mention the margin,They participated and answered few. Just gave them the share of their earning amongst the total of 25 in that they tried and didn't manage to solve more. Was motivated by their effort
1744,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Participant Y won the competition fair and square by answering more questions. I don't think it's fair to take any of their earnings away and give it to Participant X.
42,libertarian,"The rules of how the money would be distributed were clearly stated and I'm assuming that Participant X was aware of this, so it's not fair to penalize Participant Y and take away from their earnings when they did nothing wrong."
2831,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"The rules in the game were that they would receive nothing if they did not meet the parameters. They did not do as many puzzles as the other, so they got zero. I don't think it is fair to punish the person that won!"
2452,no reason,I like to give
336,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Y earned the money fairly by solving more problems under the same conditions. Changing this now could undermine the principle of merit-based earnings.
2938,meritocrat - does mention the margin,That person did almost as many problems and should be compensated accordingly.
3212,no reason,Want to share a small amount
3184,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Because I don't think it's reasonable for one person to get all the money, and the other person to get none -- even if Participant X didn't solve any problems, they still put in a certain amount of time and effort that deserves to be rewarded."
2859,misunderstand,I'm  not really interested in sharing my winnings.
3018,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"I wanted the participants to get paid according to how well they did in relation to eachother, not just if one got more answers that the other"
1417,misunderstand,"If I distribute 0, will receive zero and I will get 2.85"
853,egalitarian,"Since X earned 2.1, I decided to simply give half of it to Y. That way they both have an equal amount."
402,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Candidate X had nothing even after completing 10 problems
2135,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"I would award 0.10 only, and keep in mind , thats being generous.  I think the participant that provided the correct answers should be awarded the amount deserved."
2342,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"I felt that participant X did solve a fair amount of problems, and the fact they earned nothing because they were one correct answer short of meeting participant Y's correct answers doesn't feel entirely fair to me. I decided to give them a decent bonus, but I did not give them a majority of participant Y's earnings because that did not feel fair for participant Y."
2391,libertarian,"Because the description participant x and y received clearly said that if you answered fewer questions correctly than the other participant, then you would receive nothing. Since participant x answered fewer questions correctly, I chose to stay with the determined payout in order to uphold the rules."
559,meritocrat - does not mention margin,the fact that the participant participated should be remunerated
14,no reason,the reward effort is slightly while fairness and merit based performance
2430,meritocrat - does mention the margin,Participant X scored a little below Participant Y and according to the the instructions participant who scored lower would not get anything so i do not think it will be nice to give out from the other participant price.
2347,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"The person may not have gotten as many answers correct, but they at least deserve an almost even amount of compensation for their time and efforts"
2218,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Although person X did not get as many as person Y, I feel that person X at least tried their best and should be compensated even a little. Person Y clearly just knew more than person X which may be an unfair advantage."
857,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Both worked hard and deserve some compensation for their efforts.
2804,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"He still answered a majority of the questions, so, there should be some reward"
1579,libertarian,I think participant y won their earnings fairly
1342,no reason,i think that the they both have the same amount of things
1222,meritocrat - does mention the margin,Participant Y solved only 3 more problems than participant X
2948,meritocrat - does not mention margin,So the participant that didnt receive anything received a little
2669,meritocrat - does not mention margin,should get something for just showing up
1705,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I feel for trying participant X deserves something
746,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I was just trying to make it even. They both tried hard.
2485,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Solved almost as many problems so should receive something.
1365,no reason,Because the participant get the score of 11 which is a trial.
1314,libertarian,The participants were told upfront how earnings would be determined and paid out.  They did not have to participate.  Everything was clear and fair.
1768,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"I did not feel they should be penalized for not getting as many answers. I redistributed the payment to give the person with more correct answers double the amount, 0.10 for correct answers to the person with the most and 0.05 for the correct answers to the person with less correct. I based this off of what I would feel is fair if I were the second person."
2234,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I think the other participant should earn at least a little something. I decided to give the cents of the participant Y's earnings to X. Participant Y will get a solid number and X will get at least something.
1761,egalitarian,They played the game together they get the share equally.
515,compensate,i want participant Y to have a share also
2428,no reason,just sounded logical
2212,libertarian,I don't see any reason to redistribute funds that were earned according to a protocol understood by both parties.
2166,libertarian,The instructions were clear that they would only get a bonus if they solved at least as many as the other participant. I see no reason to change that.
1338,meritocrat - does not mention margin,The person solved less problems than the other party and that is the payment
176,meritocrat - does not mention margin,X should be compensated for trying.
1301,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Participant X should earn at least something for participating, but not more than participant Y"
2794,libertarian,the rules
2849,meritocrat - does mention the margin,The numbers where so close it isn't fair to that participants time to not get a bonus
2532,libertarian,The instructions said that the person with fewer correct answers would get nothing and the person with the most correct answers would get .15 per correct answer. Changing the bonus would not be right or moral.

731,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"The one participant guessed slightly less correct, so I felt like they deserved some money, but not fully half."
2999,no reason,to be a good person and share
1882,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Participan y deserved the full payment
3121,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I believe they should receive something for participating.
1219,meritocrat - does mention the margin,Because he solved 1 less than participant Y hence equal distribution seemed a bit fair
1335,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Y did better and should therefore benefit more than X
1133,fairness,It promotes fairness.
372,libertarian,The rules were to only compensate whoever answered more questions than the other.
1230,meritocrat - does not mention margin,The main motivation is to acknowledge the efforts made by the other participant. It feels like a fair decision.
1676,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"Because it was only a difference of a few, so I think each deserves something"
2679,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I felt that the participant who got nothing should at least get a little bonus for solving some of the problems.
690,libertarian,"I did not choose to redistribute any of participant Y's earnings based on very clear rules from the beginning-the participants would only be paid if they performed as well as if not better than their partner. Both participants agreed to those terms, and Y earned the money correctly by doing better than X. To alter the outcome now would cast an undeserving shadow of doubt on the fairness and transparency of the agreement that had been initially reached."
2787,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"I feel like Participant X should get something for their effort as they answered some questions correctly. However, Participant Y should get the larger reward since their performance was better."
3247,meritocrat - does mention the margin,I felt that there should be an equitable distribution of the earnings. I felt that was the fair thing to do since they both performed almost the same.
137,meritocrat - does not mention margin,it was the effort of y to earn his money
2651,fairness,because I believe if you have the chance to be fair then do it!!
789,meritocrat - does not mention margin,It's only fair to get the share since he participated.
2346,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"Participant X solved 2 problems, while Participant Y solved 7, which is a substantial difference. Participant X did not meet the threshold to earn anything according to the original rules."
3346,meritocrat - does mention the margin,The reward should be more or less proportional to the number of questions answered correctly.
1139,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Person x took part in the work so compensating them would be good
2687,fairness,I believe its equal and fair
1004,libertarian,"The answer is 0 because the rules said only the person who solved at least as many problems as the other would earn money. Since Y solved more than X, Y earned the money fairly. Changing that would go against the rules both agreed to."
1223,egalitarian,I wanted to make them have equal amount
700,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Participant X showed good results and should receive a small bonus
2285,libertarian,"The rules were known up front, they should be followed."
530,libertarian,"Participant Y should keep their full $2.70, and participant X should receive $0.00, as per the original terms of the task. This preserves the integrity of the incentive system and rewards performance as agreed."
2364,no reason,Participant X solved at least as many problems as Participant Y. It doesnt seem fair at all for them to have even done some work and received nothing.
166,no reason,want to give them at least a little
3178,meritocrat - does mention the margin,X answered 4 questions and should be compensated accordingly regardless of the disparity between X & Y
1956,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Because Y perform better and should be rewarded better than X.
3294,meritocrat - does not mention margin,They still got some questions right and the first person wont miss the 59 cents
2595,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I would like to be completely fair and give the other participant a deserving amount.
2590,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Even though participant x got less than participant y, they still did do something, so I think they should get some compensation."
2899,egalitarian,Person x should also be given a certain share of the amount. The amount I have choosen is to try and equalise both of them.
1278,incentives,"Redistributing it would give the loser the impression that this sort of thing would happen again.  They might rely on it happening again in the future, or even feel entitled to it.  Also, redistributing it would have demotivated the winner so they wouldn't have tried as hard in the future and would have looked for other people to do well around."
362,libertarian,"It may feel fair to share the earnings for effort, but this would go against the agreed competitive incentive structure if something was given"
3318,meritocrat - does not mention margin,If the amounts were not distributed then the other person would have got nothing for his time and effort
2316,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"Person Y clearly deserved more for solving more, but Person X did pretty well.  I did not want to penalize Y for the sake of X so tried to be fair and go with what I would have felt comfortable doing myself."
1539,no reason,It was random
2126,libertarian,The study described how the outcome would be applied.
1652,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Because I think its unfair/unkind to ask someone to do something like solve problems and then not pay them for it when that is the entire reason we are all here.
1227,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"I think the other participant deserves a little something for their work, even though they didn't outperform. I didn't want to take away too much from the winner's earnings as this goes against what they were told about payments."
2464,no reason,I think that that is a good amount to give as it seems average and not too small and not too large
3355,meritocrat - does not mention margin,The participant earned the money; therefore should get all the money.
1228,misunderstand,"So far as they are partners the reward should be shared, if one is not selfless enough he can just give any amount he wants to give."
148,libertarian,"based on the rules, person Y should get all of the money for solving significantly more problems than person X.  Person Y should not be penalized just to make things appear more 'fair' toward person X."
2932,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Y worked so very much harder, and I did not feel that they should have any funds removed.  Had the payment been larger I may have decided to take a bit for X, but the payment was not large."
2098,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"I think it's fair for them to earn one-third of the distribution considering they answered only 3 questions less correctly, 70% compared to the winner."
1896,no reason,Redistributing  and sharing
666,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Given that they all made efforts to solve the problem and that, I believe each should be paid based on the efforts made"
2259,no reason,I believe that figure will be enough
3357,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Seems fair, as long as the effort was put in."
2633,meritocrat - does not mention margin,Even though X was not able to solve he should be compensated for at least attempting it.
2132,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I thought that participation in a work activity should be paid at least a small amount and thought the 2 participants were advised in advance that an adjustment might take place so some adjustment is fair
782,libertarian,I chose not to redistribute earnings because Participant Y performed significantly better than Participant X and earned their reward according to the rules both agreed to beforehand. Redistributing would undermine the fairness of a system based on relative performance and would penalize Y despite their superior results. Upholding the original rules maintains consistency and respects the integrity of the task.
1947,meritocrat - does mention the margin,It seems unfair for one to get nothing when they both were correct about the same number of times.
2985,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"The all-or-nothing reward system seemed excessive, but the better performer should receive a bonus for their performance."
3358,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Both parties contributed effort to the project, both should be rewarded."
2149,no reason,I think people should receive what they earn
384,libertarian,"The motivation for the distribution decision was anchored on the agreed standard rules beforehand with participant Y earning the reward as a greed. As such, taking from participants would undermine the game expectations and fairness."
2939,libertarian,The original rules that both parties agreed to have not changed.  B should not be penalized because of an arbitrary decisionmaker.
216,libertarian,"I don't like the idea of wealth redistribution, even in tiny amounts like this."
2238,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"X got some problems correct as well, just fewer than Y. there shouldn't be all-or-nothing rewards."
1049,meritocrat - does mention the margin,Participant X was 2 problems short on what Participant Y solve which involved some effort. Fraction earning goes to acknowledge that effort.
3030,fairness,As close to 50% should be fair.
2613,meritocrat - does not mention margin,person y won easily and deserves the money
624,fairness,I wanted to be fair to each participant
2513,no reason,I feel that distributing money like that isn't equitable and doesn't result in positive consequences.
1853,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I am assuming that Participant X put time and effort into answering the questions also. It j7st seemed fair.
3140,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"They were due 1/3 of the total winnings due to their response rate, nothing else."
1613,no reason,because Y only earn 0.07 and it would not increase x that much
3098,libertarian,I followed your established rules.
815,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"Looking at the distribution it is clear to me that player x worked hard and put in effort. I don't think it is fair that reward is only tied to success. While a higher reward being given to Y for being more successful is fine, I think as long as both players made an effort there should be some reward, that feels more fair to me. Therefore I have X $1 because that felt like a more fair allocation to me."
3125,meritocrat - does not mention margin,He solved 13 problems. It costs 1 usd
3227,libertarian,The one who earned the money should keep it.
823,fairness,Fairness and equal sharing
1748,libertarian,"That is the agreement you made with the two participants, so I am going to honor it."
772,incentives,It will be best to make the candidate have a feel of some rewards to make the candidate try harder
1553,libertarian,I mostly based it out of the rules that each participant agreed upon before they started the task. It would be very unfair to reward participant X with anything.
2173,no reason,"It stated it would pay .15 per answer, thus .15 X 4"
2868,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"The other participant correctly did 7 more puzzles than the other one. But, the one that did 10 also did a good job of getting that many correct. I think they deserve something for their effort."
591,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"Participant X did almost as well and deserved some compensation, but not as much as Y."
2850,compensate,The participants were told that there would be a final round that may affect their distributions. I allocated a nominal amount to the losing participant.
1877,meritocrat - does mention the margin,Participant A solved about half the problems of B so they should get at least a small reward.
2465,meritocrat - does mention the margin,"The two participants scores were reasonably close, but Y still solved a few more problems. I thought my distribution of the total earned was fair given the number of problems each person solved."
2322,meritocrat - does not mention margin,"I think they participated well, but not as good at the other participant"
3013,meritocrat - does mention the margin,It was a semi even distribution between the two people
525,meritocrat - does not mention margin,I think that they should still be compensated for participating. They can get the extra cents made.
2637,libertarian,"The rules were explained ahead of time. If someone didn't think they'd be strong, they shouldn't invest the time. (But politically, I want some redistribution from high earners! This case was low stakes, so I figured my morals were still ok.)"
