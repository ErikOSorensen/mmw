The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment.

1252;misunderstand;10;Talked about sacrifice;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  maybe I failed to understand you fully but if one is getting 15 cents for each questin answered correctly, then participant x deserved to get sth agter answering 20 correct questions. Thats why I sacrificed 1 dollar.,
731;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;Meritocrat because he recognized that one had performed better - compensate loser becaus ehe felt the loser should get something;Y strongly outperformed X.

2383;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y did solve more problems than Participant X, but only a few more.  Participant should receive a reward for their time and effort, and the number of problems they solved.
2927;Meritocrat - margin matters - proportional;3;Justified distribution by doing it proportional to performance;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X performed twice as well as Y so I wanted X to keep 2/3rds of the $.
1707;Incentives;8;The participant justified the distribution by reference to incentives;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  To encourage participant X to solve more problems next time

3010;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;Meritocrat because he recognized that one had performed better - compensate loser becaus ehe felt the loser should get something;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  X put forth a reasonable amount of effort and solved only 6 fewer questions than participant Y.
605;Meritocrat - margin does not matter;2;;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision was based on the fact that both participated and the chances that one would end up with nothing and one would end up with all would not be fair. The amount was able to be split to a more even amount for both participants. Also, I feel according to the rules the winner should still benefit more than the loser and thought that something slightly more/less than half would be sufficient enough. This is all due to the fact that I , being the decision maker, is aware of the rules for the participants of the previous study.
2193;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The fact that Y got almost twice as many right as X was my primary driver. Because Y did better did not mean they should have to redistribute their earnings at all.
401;Fairness;6;Only mentions fairness in general terms;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  fairness over competition
3291;Meritocrat - margin does not matter;2;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I feel as if both tried. The higher performer deserves more but the other individual should be compensated also.

2956;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;Reference to how many questions they have completed;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate X has completed way more questions than Participate Y and it seems like they didnt try to compete for the earnings
2895;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I calculated approximately what the value of 12 versus 19 would produce out of the total of 2.85 in total earnings. I redistributed one dollar to participant X from this total leaving the remainder for participant Y based on their 19 answers. Y still earned more but in a more fair and just fashion, yes, it was fair in my opinion to give the dollar to X based on the 12 answers achieved.
2089;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I chose this amount because person x completed about half as many questions as person y.
1067;Meritocrat - margin matters;3;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  BECAUSE HE PARTICIPATED IN DOING SLIGHTLY LESS QUESTIONS THAN y
2161;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;Mention the productivity of both;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I thought is was a more fair distribution of funds based on the productivity of the participants.
1270;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would give 1.00 to participant X to recognize their significantly greater effort and performance compared to participant Y.

1488;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;The reason for one getting everything is skill;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If the decision-making task was purely chance, I would say to share the money. But if time and thought went into solving the problems, Participant Y earned the money. That was based on skill and intellect.  I am okay with getting paid for skill and intellect.
177;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt it was fair to give the other person at least some bonus because they solved only 1 less problem correctly.
233;Libertarian;1;Justification is that this is according to rules;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y solved double the problems that participant X solved. So I figured it was fair to stick with the way they were told the money would be distributed. I gave it all to the participant who solved the most problems.
1560;Logic;7;Most logical answer is justification;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  because it seem like the most logical answer
2995;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participate x did solve 11 problems and deserves some sort of compensation
2433;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Assuming that both participants spent the same amount of total time on the task and put forth the same effort, I'm not sure one should be rewarded more for performing faster. Some people just don't test as quickly as others and I'm generally a fan of quality over quantity. It's hard to determine this without more information, but my inclination given that most participants completed around 14-16 problems is to divide the money equally.
643;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y should earn more, but participant X should also earn something.
1864;Libertarian;1;Main justification is rules;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  My decision to give $0.00 of participant Ys earnings to participant X was motivated by a commitment to fairness, merit, and respecting agreed-upon rules. Both participants were informed of the conditions before the task began: only the higher performer would be rewarded. Participant Y earned the payout by solving more problems, while participant X did not meet the threshold to earn money. Redistributing the earnings afterward would undermine the integrity of the incentive structure and create uncertainty for participants who relied on the original rules. Upholding the terms that were clearly communicated and agreed upon supports trust and fairness in the study.
151;Libertarian;1;Justification based on rules;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  It is fair not to distribute anything because the rules were clear, and earnings were to be based on relative performance, and you solved for more than 15 times times X 10
810;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant x participated and answered 8 questions, as a little reward for taking part in the participation.

164;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;Focus on effort as basis for meritocarcy;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both exhibited good effort
314;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Assuming Player X tried their best, they deserve something for their time.
296;Meritocrast - margin matters;3;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  They participated and answered few. Just gave them the share of their earning amongst the total of 25 in that they tried and didn't manage to solve more. Was motivated by their effort
1744;Meritocrat - margin does not matter;2;;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant Y won the competition fair and square by answering more questions. I don't think it's fair to take any of their earnings away and give it to Participant X.
42;Libertarian;1;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules of how the money would be distributed were clearly stated and I'm assuming that Participant X was aware of this, so it's not fair to penalize Participant Y and take away from their earnings when they did nothing wrong.
2831;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The rules in the game were that they would receive nothing if they did not meet the parameters. They did not do as many puzzles as the other, so they got zero. I don't think it is fair to punish the person that won!
2452;No reason;9;Only states that he likes to give, which is not relevant;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I like to give
336;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Y earned the money fairly by solving more problems under the same conditions. Changing this now could undermine the principle of merit-based earnings.
2938;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  That person did almost as many problems and should be compensated accordingly.
3212;No reason;9;Only states what he did;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Want to share a small amount
3184;Meritocrat - margin does not matter;2;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because I don't think it's reasonable for one person to get all the money, and the other person to get none -- even if Participant X didn't solve any problems, they still put in a certain amount of time and effort that deserves to be rewarded.
2859;Misunderstand;10;Talked about his own winnings;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I'm  not really interested in sharing my winnings.
3018;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I wanted the participants to get paid according to how well they did in relation to eachother, not just if one got more answers that the other
1417;Misunderstand;10;talks about what he himself will end up with;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  If I distribute 0, will receive zero and I will get 2.85
853;Egalitarian;4;Justifies by both of them getting the same;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a low share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Since X earned 2.1, I decided to simply give half of it to Y. That way they both have an equal amount.
402;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Candidate X had nothing even after completing 10 problems
2135;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I would award 0.10 only, and keep in mind , thats being generous.  I think the participant that provided the correct answers should be awarded the amount deserved.
2342;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave a Moderate share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I felt that participant X did solve a fair amount of problems, and the fact they earned nothing because they were one correct answer short of meeting participant Y's correct answers doesn't feel entirely fair to me. I decided to give them a decent bonus, but I did not give them a majority of participant Y's earnings because that did not feel fair for participant Y.
2391;Libertarian;1;Justified by rules;Y barely outperformed X. The DM gave all to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Because the description participant x and y received clearly said that if you answered fewer questions correctly than the other participant, then you would receive nothing. Since participant x answered fewer questions correctly, I chose to stay with the determined payout in order to uphold the rules.
559;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the fact that the participant participated should be remunerated
14;No reason;9;Hard to understand the meaning;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  the reward effort is slightly while fairness and merit based performance
2430;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Participant X scored a little below Participant Y and according to the the instructions participant who scored lower would not get anything so i do not think it will be nice to give out from the other participant price.
2347;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the 'Show Distribution' treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  The person may not have gotten as many answers correct, but they at least deserve an almost even amount of compensation for their time and efforts
2218;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Although person X did not get as many as person Y, I feel that person X at least tried their best and should be compensated even a little. Person Y clearly just knew more than person X which may be an unfair advantage.
857;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y slightly outperformed X. The DM gave an equal share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  Both worked hard and deserve some compensation for their efforts.

1768;Meritocrats - margin matters;3;;Y moderately outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I did not feel they should be penalized for not getting as many answers. I redistributed the payment to give the person with more correct answers double the amount, 0.10 for correct answers to the person with the most and 0.05 for the correct answers to the person with less correct. I based this off of what I would feel is fair if I were the second person.
2234;Meritocrats - margin does not matter;2;;Y strongly outperformed X. The DM gave a high share to Y. In the baseline treatment. Motivation provided by DM:  I think the other participant should earn at least a little something. I decided to give the cents of the participant Y's earnings to X. Participant Y will get a solid number and X will get at least something.
